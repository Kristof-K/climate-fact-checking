rainy rainforest "the amazon basically makes half of its own rainfall
moisture comes in off the atlantic ocean, falls as rain in the amazon forest, and about three-quarters of it evaporates back into the atmosphere
this then gets carried west and most of it turns into rain again closer to the andes, where it falls and feeds the amazon river system."

selected text level articlevocabulary it’s estimated that roughly 20 percent of the amazon rainforest has disappeared during the past 50 years
deforestation due to agriculture, urbanization, and illegal logging is not only threatening the millions of unique plant and animal species native to the amazon river region, it’s affecting humans worldwide
whether it’s extreme drought in são paulo, brazil, the multibillion-dollar illegal wildlife trade, or the catastrophic impacts of climate change, threats to the amazon are having a very tangible ripple effect around the globe
the good news is that some of the world’s most accomplished scientists are backing a big push to save the forest
we sat down with one of those scientists—national geographic explorer dr. thomas lovejoy—to talk about the state of the amazon and why conservation matters
ng: you’ve worked in the amazon for more than 50 years
how have you seen the region change?
tl: in the 1960s, there was only one highway in the entire amazon basin
that’s an area as large as the continental united states with one highway and three million people
today, there are between 30 million to 40 million people, countless roads, and it’s about 20 percent deforested
but on the plus side, 50 years ago there were only two national parks—in venezuela—and a national forest and an indigenous reserve in brazil
today, more than 50 percent of the amazon is under some form of protection
the real challenge is to move toward a much more integrated approach to planning and managing the amazon
when we talk about conservation of the amazon, it’s hard for many people to relate because they don’t feel connected to the region
how can we change that?
there are actually a lot of direct connections between our daily lives and the amazon, no matter how far away we are
for example, there’s a big, nasty viper called the bushmaster that lives in the amazon
this snake kills its prey with venom that causes the prey’s blood pressure to go to zero
scientists in são paulo discovered that this venom actually works by affecting a previously unknown system in the body called the angiotensin system
this discovery then allowed pharmaceutical chemists to design the first ace inhibitor medicines
today, millions of people use these medicines to treat high blood pressure
they have longer, fuller, and more productive lives, and they have the venom of a nasty snake far away in the amazon to thank for it
a connection that affects everyone on the planet is climate change
reforestation is essentially a way of removing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
the existing forest is absorbing some carbon dioxide already
in terms of the global carbon cycle, tropical forests have a carbon sink roughly equal to half of what is in the atmosphere
about half of that is in the amazon
this means to lose the amazon would dramatically increase climate change
and there are some extraordinary local connections as well
the amazon basically makes half of its own rainfall
moisture comes in off the atlantic ocean, falls as rain in the amazon forest, and about three-quarters of it evaporates back into the atmosphere
this then gets carried west and most of it turns into rain again closer to the andes mountains, where it falls and feeds the amazon river system
this system holds about 20 percent of the world’s river water, which is huge
what isn’t rained out of the andes disperses north and south, with the southern portion being really important for agriculture in brazil and argentina
so, são paulo’s current drought—possibly the worst in its history—is happening partly because the region is getting less rainfall from the amazon
what is your vision for the future of the amazon?
there’s been a lot of damage done and forest lost, but nothing is gone until it’s gone
a lot of the negative buzz out there—like the initial projection of species extinctions that i made in 1980—is made in the hope that it will in fact turn out to be a lot less because you’ve gotten people’s attention
ideally what we hope is for the amazon to return to be about 90% of the extent of its original forest, and for it to be managed collectively by the nine amazon nations (brazil, peru, colombia, venezuela, ecuador, bolivia, guyana, suriname, and french guiana)
we want to see more integrated planning between the people in charge of transportation, energy, agriculture, and the other industries in the region
we think amazon cities can have higher quality of life and keep people in existing cities so there’s less reason to deforest
fast fact
the birthplace of biodiversitythere’s a reason scientists working in the amazon had to come up with a term to describe the incredible wealth of plant and animal species present in the amazon basin
the region is home to one in ten species known on earth
fast fact
carbon contributor?while the amazon is currently a carbon sink—meaning it stores carbon dioxide that would otherwise contribute to climate change—that might be changing
the world wildlife fund states that forest loss and reduced rainfall may turn the amazon into a net source rather than capturer of carbon emissions
the carbon cycle the carbon cycle describes how carbon transfers between different reservoirs located on earth
this cycle is important for maintaining a stable climate and carbon balance on earth

articlevocabulary carbon is an essential element for all life forms on earth
whether these life forms take in carbon to help manufacture food or release carbon as part of respiration, the intake and output of carbon is a component of all plant and animal life
carbon is in a constant state of movement from place to place
it is stored in what are known as reservoirs, and it moves between these reservoirs through a variety of processes, including photosynthesis, burning fossil fuels, and simply releasing breath from the lungs
the movement of carbon from reservoir to reservoir is known as the carbon cycle
carbon can be stored in a variety of reservoirs, including plants and animals, which is why they are considered carbon life forms
carbon is used by plants to build leaves and stems, which are then digested by animals and used for cellular growth
in the atmosphere, carbon is stored in the form of gases, such as carbon dioxide
it is also stored in oceans, captured by many types of marine organisms
some organisms, such as clams or coral, use the carbon to form shells and skeletons
most of the carbon on the planet is contained within rocks, minerals, and other sediment buried beneath the surface of the planet
because earth is a closed system, the amount of carbon on the planet never changes
however, the amount of carbon in a specific reservoir can change over time as carbon moves from one reservoir to another
for example, some carbon in the atmosphere might be captured by plants to make food during photosynthesis
this carbon can then be ingested and stored in animals that eat the plants
when the animals die, they decompose, and their remains become sediment, trapping the stored carbon in layers that eventually turn into rock or minerals
some of this sediment might form fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, or natural gas, which release carbon back into the atmosphere when the fuel is burned
the carbon cycle is vital to life on earth
nature tends to keep carbon levels balanced, meaning that the amount of carbon naturally released from reservoirs is equal to the amount that is naturally absorbed by reservoirs
maintaining this carbon balance allows the planet to remain hospitable for life
scientists believe that humans have upset this balance by burning fossil fuels, which has added more carbon to the atmosphere than usual and led to climate change and global warming
carbon sources and sinks carbon sinks absorb more carbon than they release, while carbon sources release more carbon than they absorb

articlevocabulary carbon is an element that is essential to all life on earth
carbon makes up the fats and carbohydrates of our food and is part of the molecules, like dna and protein, that make up our bodies
carbon, in the form of carbon dioxide, is even a part of the air we breathe
it is also stored in places like the ocean, rocks, fossil fuels, and plants
the carbon cycle describes the flow of carbon between each of these places
for example, carbon continually flows in and out of the atmosphere and also living things
as plants photosynthesize, they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
when plants die, the carbon goes into the soil, and microbes can release the carbon back into the atmosphere through decomposition
forests are typically carbon sinks, places that absorb more carbon than they release
they continually take carbon out of the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis
the ocean is another example of a carbon sink, absorbing a large amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
some processes release more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than they absorb
any process that uses fossil fuels—such as burning coal to make electricity—releases a lot of carbon into the atmosphere
raising cattle for food also releases a lot of carbon into the atmosphere
these processes that release carbon into the atmosphere are known as carbon sources
ideally, the carbon cycle would keep earth’s carbon concentrations in balance, moving the carbon from place to place and keeping atmospheric carbon dioxide levels steady
however, the carbon cycle is changing because of human activity
people are releasing more carbon into the atmosphere by using fossil fuels and maintaining large livestock operations
deforestation is depleting earth’s supply of carbon sinks
as a result, the amount of carbon in the atmosphere is rising
earth's changing climate climate change is a long-term shift in global or regional climate patterns
often climate change refers specifically to the rise in global temperatures from the mid 20th century to present

selected text level articlevocabulary climate is the long-term pattern of weather in a particular area
weather can change from hour to hour, day to day, month to month or even from year to year
for periods of 30 years or more, however, distinct weather patterns occur
a desert might experience a rainy week, but over the long term, the region receives very little rainfall
it has a dry climate
because climates are mostly constant, living things can adapt to them
polar bears have adapted to stay warm in polar climates, while cacti have evolved to hold onto water in dry climates
the enormous variety of life on earth results in large part from the variety of climates that exist
climates do change, however—they just change very slowly, over hundreds or even thousands of years
as climates change, organisms that live in the area must adapt, relocate, or risk going extinct
earth’s changing climate
earth’s climate has changed many times
for example, fossils from the cretaceous period (144 to 65 million years ago) show that earth was much warmer than it is today
fossilized plants and animals that normally live in warm environments have been found at much higher latitudes than they could survive at today
for instance, breadfruit trees (artocarpus altilis), now found on tropical islands, grew as far north as greenland
earth has also experienced several major ice ages—at least four in the past 500,000 years
during these periods, earth’s temperature decreased, causing an expansion of ice sheets and glaciers
the most recent ice age began about two million years ago and peaked about 20,000 years ago
the ice caps began retreating 18,000 years ago
they have not disappeared completely, however
their presence in antarctica and greenland suggests earth is still in a sort of ice age
many scientists believe we are in an interglacial period, when warmer temperatures have caused the ice caps to recede
many centuries from now, the glaciers may advance again
climatologists look for evidence of past climate change in many different places
like clumsy criminals, glaciers leave many clues behind them
they scratch and scour rocks as they move
they deposit sediment known as glacial till
this sediment sometimes forms mounds or ridges called moraines
glaciers also form elongated oval hills known as drumlins
all of these geographic features on land that currently has no glaciers suggest that glaciers were once there
scientists also have chemical evidence of ice ages from sediments and sedimentary rocks
some rocks only form from glacial material
their presence under the ocean or on land also tells scientists that glaciers were once present in these areas
scientists also have paleontological evidence—fossils
fossils show what kinds of animals and plants lived in certain areas
during ice ages, organisms that are adapted to cold weather can increase their range, moving closer to the equator
organisms that are adapted to warm weather may lose part of their habitat, or even go extinct
climate changes occur over shorter periods, as well
for example, the so-called little ice age lasted only a few hundred years, peaking during the 16th and 17th centuries
during this time, average global temperatures were 1 to 1.5 degrees celsius (2 to 3 degrees fahrenheit) cooler than they are today
a change of one or two degrees might not seem like a lot, but it was enough to cause some pretty massive effects
for instance, glaciers grew larger and sometimes engulfed whole mountain villages
winters were longer than usual, limiting the growing seasons of crops
in northern europe, people deserted farms and villages to avoid starvation
one way scientists have learned about the little ice age is by studying the rings of trees that are more than 300 years old
the thickness of tree rings is related to the amount of the trees’ annual growth
this in turn is related to climate changes
during times of drought or cold, trees could not grow as much
the rings would be closer together
some climate changes are almost predictable
one example of regular climate change results from the warming of the surface waters of the tropical eastern pacific ocean
this warming is called el niño—the child—because it tends to begin around christmas
in normal years, trade winds blow steadily across the ocean from east to west, dragging warm surface water along in the same direction
this produces a shallow layer of warm water in the eastern pacific and a buildup of warm water in the west
every few years, normal winds falter and ocean currents reverse
this is el niño
warm water deepens in the eastern pacific
this, in turn, produces dramatic climate changes
rain decreases in australia and southern asia, and freak storms may pound pacific islands and the west coast of the americas
within a year or two, el niño ends, and climate systems return to normal
natural causes of climate change
climate changes happen for a variety of reasons
some of these reasons have to do with earth’s atmosphere
the climate change brought by el niño, which relies on winds and ocean currents, is an example of natural atmospheric changes
natural climate change can also be affected by forces outside earth’s atmosphere
for instance, the 100,000-year cycles of ice ages are probably related to changes in the tilt of earth’s axis and the shape of its orbit around the sun
those planetary factors change slowly over time and affect how much of the sun’s energy reaches different parts of the world in different seasons
the impact of large meteorites on earth could also cause climate change
the impact of a meteor would send millions of tons of debris into the atmosphere
this debris would block at least some of the sun’s rays, making it cold and dark
this climate change would severely limit what organisms could survive
many paleontologists believe the impact of a meteor or comet contributed to the extinction of the dinosaurs
dinosaurs simply could not survive in a cool, dark climate
their bodies could not adjust to the cold, and the dark limited the growth of plants on which they fed
plate tectonics also play a role in climate changes
earth’s continental plates have moved a great deal over time
more than 200 million years ago, the continents were merged together as one giant landmass called pangaea
as the continents broke apart and moved, their positions on earth changed, and so did the movements of ocean currents
both of these changes had effects on climate
changes in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere also have an impact on climate change
gases like carbon dioxide trap the sun’s heat in earth’s atmosphere, causing temperatures on the surface to rise
volcanoes—both on land and under the ocean—release greenhouse gases, so if the eruption only reaches the troposphere the additional gases contribute to warming
however, if the eruption is powerful enough to reach the stratosphere particles reflect sunlight back into space causing periods of cooling regionally
human causes of climate change
some human activities release greenhouse gases—burning fossil fuels for transportation and electricity, or using technology that increases meat production, for instance
trees absorb carbon dioxide, so cutting down forests for timber or development contributes to the greenhouse effect
so do factories that emit pollutants into the atmosphere
many scientists are worried that these activities are causing dramatic and dangerous changes in earth’s climate
average temperatures around the world have risen since about 1880, when scientists began tracking them
the seven warmest years of the 20th century occurred in the 1990s
this warming trend may be a sign that the greenhouse effect is increasing because of human activity
this climate change is often referred to as “global warming.”
global warming is often linked to the burning of fossil fuels—coal, oil, and natural gas—by industries and cars
warming is also linked to the destruction of tropical forests
the university of california riverside and nasa estimate human activity has increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by about 30 percent in the past 150 years
the amount of methane, a potent greehouse gas produced by decomposing plant and animal matter, is also increasing
increased amounts of methane in earth’s atmosphere are usually linked to agricultural development and industrial technology
as economies grow, populations consume more goods and throw away more materials
large landfills, filled with decomposing waste, release tons of methane into the atmosphere
chlorofluorocarbon (cfc), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (hcfc), and hydrofluorocarbon (hfc) chemicals are used in refrigeration and aerosol sprays
these chemicals are also greenhouse gases
many countries are working to phase out their use, and some have laws to prevent companies from manufacturing them
global warming
as the proportion of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere rises, so does the temperature of earth
climatologists worry that the global temperature will increase so much that ice caps will begin melting within the next several decades
this would cause the sea level to rise
coastal areas, including many low-lying islands, would be flooded
severe climate change may bring more severe weather patterns—more hurricanes, typhoons, and tornadoes
more precipitation would fall in some places and far less in others
regions where crops now grow could become deserts
as climates change, so do the habitats for living things
animals that live in an area may become threatened
many human societies depend on specific crops for food, clothing, and trade
if the climate of an area changes, the people who live there may no longer be able to grow the crops they depend on for survival
some scientists worry that as earth warms, tropical diseases such as malaria, west nile virus, and yellow fever will expand into more temperate regions
the temperature will continue to rise unless preventive steps are taken
most climatologists agree that we must reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere
there are many ways to do this, including:
drive less
use public transportation, carpool, walk, or ride a bike
fly less
airplanes produce huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions
reduce, reuse, and recycle
plant a tree
trees absorb carbon dioxide, keeping it out of the atmosphere
use less electricity
eat less meat
cows are one of the biggest methane producers
support alternative energy sources that don’t burn fossil fuels, such as solar power and wind energy
the climate has changed many times during earth’s history, but the changes have occurred slowly, over thousands of years
only since the industrial revolution have human activities begun to influence climate—and scientists are still working to understand what the consequences might be
fast fact
cool warming could the current phase of climate changeglobal warmingcause another little ice age?
as strange as it sounds, some scientists believe it could
if melting glaciers release large amounts of freshwater into the oceans, this could disrupt the ocean conveyor belt, an important circulation system that moves seawater around the globe
stopping this cycle could possibly cause cooling of 3 to 5 degrees celsius (5-9 degrees fahrenheit) in the ocean and atmosphere

selected text level articlevocabulary on may 9, 2013, an instrument near the summit of mauna loa in hawai'i, united states, recorded a long-awaited climate milestone: the amount of carbon dioxide (co2)in the atmosphere there had exceeded 400 parts per million (ppm) for the first time in 55 years of measurement—and probably more than thre million years of earth history
the last time the concentration of earth's main greenhouse gas reached this mark, horses and camels lived in the high arctic
seas were at least 9.1 meters (30 feet higher)—at a level that today would inundate major cities around the world
the planet was about 2 to 3 degrees celsius (3.6 to 5.4 degrees fahrenheit) warmer
but earth then was in the final stage of a prolonged greenhouse epoch, and co2 concentrations were on their way down
however, the may 2013 reading represented something different
this time, 400 ppm was a milepost on a far more rapid uphill climb toward an uncertain climate future
two independent teams of scientists measure co2 on mauna loa: one from the u.s. national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa), the other from the scripps institution of oceanography
the noaa team was the first to post word on its website: the daily average for may 9 was 400.03 ppm
the scripps team later confirmed the milestone had been crossed
the scripps team was led by ralph keeling, son of the late charles david keeling, who started the mauna loa measurements in 1958 
since then the "keeling curve," showing the steady climb in co2 levels caused primarily by burning fossil fuels, has become an icon of climate change
when the elder keeling started at mauna loa, the co2 level was at 315 ppm
when he died in june 2005, it was at 382. why did he keep at it for 47 years, fighting off periodic efforts to cut his funding?
his father, he once wrote, had passed onto him a "faith that the world could be made better by devotion to just causes."
now his son and the noaa team have taken over a measurement that captures, more than any other single number, the extent to which we are changing the world
setting the record straight
the co2 level had been hovering above 399 ppm since late april, 2013 
the scripps lab opened the vigil to the public by sending out daily tweets (under the handle @keeling_curve) almost as soon as the data could be downloaded from mauna loa, at 5 a.m. hawai'i time
noaa took to updating its website daily
the two labs' measurements typically agree within 0.2 ppm
both measure the amount of co2 in an air sample by measuring how much infrared radiation it absorbs—the same process by which co2 in the atmosphere traps heat and warms the whole planet
the measurement noaa reported for thursday, may 9, 400.03 ppm, was for a single day
each data point on the keeling curve, however, is actually an average of all the measurements made at mauna loa over an entire month
just under a year later, april 2014 marked the first time the monthly average co2 level was measured at 400 ppm at mauna loa
in 2016, an even more significant milestone was reached: the global annual minimum levels of co2 in the atmosphere measured above 400 ppm
to understand the significance of this milestone, it is necessary to understand that atmospheric co2 levels are cyclical, with annual maximums and minimums
co2 peaks in may every year
by june the levels begin falling, as spring kicks into high gear in the northern hemisphere, where most of the planet's land is concentrated, and plants draw co2 out of the atmosphere to fuel their new growth
by november, the co2 level is typically five or six ppm lower than its spring levels
then the curve turns upward again: in the winter, plants stop making new carbohydrates but continue to burn the old, respiring co2 back into the atmosphere
this seasonal sawtooth—think of it as the breath of northern forests—is the natural part of the keeling curve
the artificial part is its steady upward climb from one year to the next
both were discovered at mauna loa
dave keeling, as he was known, chose the hawaiian mountain for his measurements because, at over 3,353 meters (11,000 feet) and in the middle of the pacific, it is far from forests or smokestacks that might put a local bias on the data
but even mauna loa is not perfectly representative of the whole planet
noaa also monitors co2 at a global network of stations, and the global average consistently lags the mauna loa number by a few parts per million—for a simple reason
"mauna loa is higher because most of the fossil fuel co2 is emitted in the northern hemisphere," noaa scientist pieter tans says
it takes about a year, he says, for northern pollution to spread through the southern hemisphere
on the other hand, mauna loa lags the arctic, where co2 levels are higher
a year before the historic measurements were recorded at mauna loa, noaa reported that the average of its arctic measurements had exceeded 400 ppm for the entire month of may, not just for a single day
the rest of the planet soon caught up with mauna loa’s measurements
by 2015, the annual global average co2 levels exceeded 400 ppm
what does passing this threshold mean?
back to the pliocene?
in a way, 400 ppm is an arbitrary milestone, like a .400 batting average in baseball
but the fact that no one has batted .400 since ted williams in 1941 still says something important about baseball
the same goes for co2 in earth's atmosphere
the last time the concentration of co2 was as high as 400 ppm was probably in the pliocene epoch, between 2.6 million and 5.3 million years ago
until the 20th century, it certainly hadn't exceeded 300 ppm, let alone 400 ppm, for at least 800,000 years
that's how far back scientists have been able to measure co2 directly in bubbles of ancient air trapped in antarctic ice cores
but tens of millions of years ago, co2 must have been much higher than it is now—there's no other way to explain how warm earth was then
in the eocene, some 50 million years ago, there were alligators and tapirs on ellesmere island, which lies off northern greenland in the canadian arctic
they were living in swampy forests like those in the southeastern united states today
co2 may have been anywhere from two to 10 times higher in the eocene than it is today
on april 18, 2017, mauna loa observatory recorded a new record
for the first time, co2 level were measured at over 410 ppm

articlevocabulary climate refugees are people who must leave their homes and communities because of the effects of climate change and global warming
climate change is caused by natural events, such as volcanic eruptions, as well as human activities
climate change has happened many times since earth was formed billions of years ago
global warming is the most recent period of climate change
human activities like burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests contribute to global warming because they release greenhouse gases
greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere
rising temperatures associated with global warming cause glaciers and ice caps to melt
this can cause flooding and make sea levels rise
rising temperatures also lead to droughts and desertification—the transformation of arable land to desert
some of these effects, such as sea level rise, can put land completely underwater, making it uninhabitable
others effects, such as drought, make it impossible for people in the region to support themselves
climate refugees belong to a larger group of immigrants known as environmental refugees
environmental refugees include immigrants forced to flee because of natural disasters, such as volcanoes and tsunamis
the international red cross estimates that there are more environmental refugees than political refugees fleeing from wars and other conflicts
the united nations high commissioner for refugees (unhcr) says 36 million people were displaced by natural disasters in 2009, the last year such a report was taken
a 2021 world bank reported estimated that the climate crisis could drive more than 200 million people to move within their countries by 2050 
in 2020 the institute for economics and peace put the number of people at risk of displacement by 2050 at over 1 billion
sea-level rise the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) predicts that sea levels will rise a total of 0.18 to 0.6 meters (seven inches to two feet) between 1990 and 2100 
rising sea levels already cause problems in low-lying coastal areas of the world
for instance, about half the population of bangladesh lives less than five meters (16.5 feet) above sea level
in 1995, bangladesh’s bhola island was half-submerged by rising sea levels, leaving 500,000 people homeless
scientists predict bangladesh will lose 17 percent of its land by 2050 due to flooding caused by climate change
the loss of land could lead to as many as 20 million climate refugees from bangladesh
the u.s. state of louisiana loses about 65 square kilometers (25 square miles) to the sea every year
most land is eroding near the mississippi delta
sea-level rise puts the productive fisheries around the delta at risk as wetlands are submerged
the wetland ecosystem will be lost to more saltwater habitat, and fishermen will have to go further from shore to pursue fish
the loss of wetlands also makes damage from storms like hurricane katrina more likely
maldives maldives, an island nation in the indian ocean, is perhaps the country most threatened by sea level rise
maldives rises only 2.4 meters (eight feet) above sea level at its highest point
sea-level rise will likely create climate refugees because of changes in both economy and habitat
tourism supports more than 25 percent of the maldivian economy
as the islands slowly sink underwater, they can support fewer tourists and tourist facilities, such as hotels
fishing is the nation’s second-largest industry
the environment and economy of maldives are threatened as sea levels rise and become less salty
the melting of polar ice caps increases the amount of freshwater in the ocean, as well as causing sea levels to rise
the increased amount of freshwater in the marine environment threatens the delicate ecosystem of coral reefs that surround the islands
the habitat may not be able to support as many fish, threatening the fisheries around maldives
other fish may not be able to adapt to the less-salty water
without income generated from tourism or fishing, many maldivians may be forced to migrate to seek new jobs
finally, sea level rise may sink all 1,200 islands of maldives
this would force all maldivians to find new places to live
maldives leaders have worked with leaders in australia, india, and sri lanka to plan an evacuation program should maldives become uninhabitable
venice the urban area of venice, italy, is also threatened by sea level rise
venice is an ancient city built on a series of islands in a lagoon on the coast of the adriatic sea
the city has always been threatened by storms and storm surges
venice’s main "streets" are actually canals and smaller waterways
as the tide comes in, entire piazzas, or town squares, are put under several centimeters of water
in the past century, flooding has become more frequent
in 1900, the city’s main piazza was underwater seven times
in 1996, it flooded 99 times
like maldives, venice depends on tourism to support its economy
as the city floods more often, fewer tourists will visit and tourism facilities will be harder to maintain
flooding and mold will threaten popular tourist sites, such as st. mark’s basilica and the doge’s palace
venetians may be forced to migrate as their city and their economy sink
many other coastal cities throughout the world are located in low-lying areas vulnerable to sea level rise: manhattan, new york, united states; london, england; shanghai, china; hamburg, germany; bangkok, thailand; jakarta, indonesia; mumbai, india; manila, philippines; and buenos aires, argentina
drought while rising seas threaten coastal regions, drought can create climate refugees inland
when people cannot grow crops on the land where they live, they have to move somewhere else in order to survive
for example, the gobi desert in china expands more than 3,600 square kilometers (1,390 square miles) every year
farmers and merchants in the area surrounding the gobi migrate to china’s crowded urban areas as grasslands are overtaken by desert
morocco, tunisia, and libya each lose more than 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of productive land every year to desertification
these residents on the edge of the sahara desert may move to cities in the maghreb, a region of northwest africa
they may also choose to move to the more developed countries of europe
residents near the horn of africa are especially vulnerable to drought and desertification
most rural residents in somalia, ethiopia, and eritrea engage in subsistence agriculture
subsistence agriculture means the farmers produce enough crops for themselves, their families, and communities
they do not sell their produce on the national or international market
many subsistence farmers depend on their crops to feed their livestock
years of severe drought prevent crops from growing, which also prevents livestock from being raised
thousands of somalis and ethiopians, threatened by starvation and poverty, have already fled to refugee camps in kenya
camps that were designed to provide temporary shelter for 90,000 people are now home to twice that number
refugee status environmental refugees are not protected by international laws
they face greater political risks than refugees who flee their homes due to conflict or political oppression
unlike traditional refugees, climate refugees may be sent back to their devastated homeland or forced into a refugee camp
most climate refugees are internal migrants
internal migration is the process of people moving elsewhere in their own country
often, climate refugees are rural and coastal residents who are forced to migrate to urban areas
these climate refugees face numerous problems
skills such as herding and farming are not relevant in urban areas
rural farmers are often more self-sufficient than many urban dwellers; they may not be familiar with depending on a corporation or other people for employment
climate refugees who migrate outside their home countries face other difficulties
they must adjust to different laws, languages, and cultures
climate refugees may encounter conflict with indigenous residents
educational and health care systems must adjust to a sudden, new population
this population may speak a different language or have different customs than the native population
climate change may also increase the number of traditional refugees
antonio guterres, the u.n. high commissioner for refugees, has noted, “climate change can enhance the competition for resources—water, food, grazing lands—and that competition can trigger conflict.”

articlevocabulary global warming is the long-term warming of the planet’s overall temperature
though this warming trend has been going on for a long time, its pace has significantly increased in the last hundred years due to the burning of fossil fuels
as the human population has increased, so has the volume of fossil fuels burned
fossil fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas, and burning them causes what is known as the “greenhouse effect” in earth’s atmosphere
the greenhouse effect is when the sun’s rays penetrate the atmosphere, but when that heat is reflected off the surface cannot escape back into space
gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels prevent the heat from leaving the atmosphere
these greenhouse gasses are carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, water vapor, methane, and nitrous oxide
the excess heat in the atmosphere has caused the average global temperature to rise overtime, otherwise known as global warming
global warming has presented another issue called climate change
sometimes these phrases are used interchangeably, however, they are different
climate change refers to changes in weather patterns and growing seasons around the world
it also refers to sea level rise caused by the expansion of warmer seas and melting ice sheets and glaciers
global warming causes climate change, which poses a serious threat to life on earth in the forms of widespread flooding and extreme weather
scientists continue to study global warming and its impact on earth
the planet is warming, from north pole to south pole
since 1906, the global average surface temperature has increased by more than 1.6 degrees fahrenheit (0.9 degrees celsius)—even more in sensitive polar regions
and the impacts of rising temperatures aren’t waiting for some far-flung future–the effects of global warming are appearing right now
the heat is melting glaciers and sea ice, shifting precipitation patterns, and setting animals on the move
many people think of global warming and climate change as synonyms, but scientists prefer to use “climate change” when describing the complex shifts now affecting our planet’s weather and climate systems
climate change encompasses not only rising average temperatures but also extreme weather events, shifting wildlife populations and habitats, rising seas, and a range of other impacts
all of these changes are emerging as humans continue to add heat-trapping greenhouse gases to the atmosphere
scientists already have documented these impacts of climate change:
ice is melting worldwide, especially at the earth’s poles
this includes mountain glaciers, ice sheets covering west antarctica and greenland, and arctic sea ice
in montana's glacier national park the number of glaciers has declined to fewer than 30 from more than 150 in 1910 
much of this melting ice contributes to sea-level rise
global sea levels are rising 0.13 inches (3.2 millimeters) a year
the rise is occurring at a faster rate in recent years and is predicted to accelerate in the coming decades
rising temperatures are affecting wildlife and their habitats
vanishing ice has challenged species such as the adélie penguin in antarctica, where some populations on the western peninsula have collapsed by 90 percent or more
as temperatures change, many species are on the move
some butterflies, foxes, and alpine plants have migrated farther north or to higher, cooler areas
precipitation (rain and snowfall) has increased across the globe, on average
yet some regions are experiencing more severe drought, increasing the risk of wildfires, lost crops, and drinking water shortages
some species—including mosquitoes, ticks, jellyfish, and crop pests—are thriving
booming populations of bark beetles that feed on spruce and pine trees, for example, have devastated millions of forested acres in the u.s. an iceberg melts in the waters off antarctica
climate change has accelerated the rate of ice loss across the continent
as sea levels rise, salty ocean waters encroach into florida’s everglades
native plants and animals struggle to adapt to the changing conditions
the western u.s. has been locked in a drought for years
the dry, hot weather has increased the intensity and destructiveness of forest fires
bunches of oil palm fruit are harvested by hand and then trucked to a mill in mainland malaysia, where they are processed
ancient forests around the tropics are being cut down to make space for palm oil plantations
when these forests are lost, the carbon they held locked up in their tissues is released into the atmosphere, contributing to further global warming
in the high plains of bolivia, a man surveys the baked remains of what was the country’s second largest lake, lake poopó
drought and management issues have caused the lake to dry up
climate change is impacting flora and fauna across the arctic
experts warn that many polar bears like this one are having trouble finding food as the sea ice they historically relied on thins and melts earlier
lake urmia, in iran, is a critical bird habitat and used to be a popular tourist destination
it is drying up because of climate change and management issues
the scherer power plant in juliet, georgia, is the largest coal-fired power plant in the u.s. it burns 34,000 tons of coal daily, pumping over 25 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year
ice melts on a mountain lake
lakes around the world are freezing less and less over time, and in a few decades, thousands of lakes around the world may lose their winter ice cover entirely
the amazon is losing the equivalent of nearly one million soccer fields of forest cover each year, much of which is cut down to make way for agriculture
when forest is lost, the carbon it sequestered ends up in the atmosphere, accelerating climate change
in glacier national park, forests are feeling the effects of early snowmelt and long, dry summers
the stresses on the park's flora are exacterbated by climate change

photograph by paul nicklen, nat geo image collection other effects could take place later this century, if warming continues
these include:
sea levels are expected to rise between 10 and 32 inches (26 and 82 centimeters) or higher by the end of the century
hurricanes and other storms are likely to become stronger
floods and droughts will become more common
large parts of the u.s., for example, face a higher risk of decades-long "megadroughts" by 2100 
less freshwater will be available, since glaciers store about three-quarters of the world's freshwater
some diseases will spread, such as mosquito-borne malaria (and the 2016 resurgence of the zika virus)
ecosystems will continue to change: some species will move farther north or become more successful; others, such as polar bears, won’t be able to adapt and could become extinct

articlevocabulary global warming describes the current rise in the average temperature of earth’s air and oceans
global warming is often described as the most recent example of climate change
earth’s climate has changed many times
our planet has gone through multiple ice ages, in which ice sheets and glaciers covered large portions of earth
it has also gone through warm periods when temperatures were higher than they are today
past changes in earth’s temperature happened very slowly, over hundreds of thousands of years
however, the recent warming trend is happening much faster than it ever has
natural cycles of warming and cooling are not enough to explain the amount of warming we have experienced in such a short time—only human activities can account for it
scientists worry that the climate is changing faster than some living things can adapt to it
in 1988, the world meteorological organization and the united nations environment programme established a committee of climatologists, meteorologists, geographers, and other scientists from around the world
this intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) includes thousands of scientists who review the most up-to-date research available related to global warming and climate change
the ipcc evaluates the risk of climate change caused by human activities
according to the ipcc’s most recent report (in 2007), earth’s average surface temperatures have risen about 0.74 degrees celsius (1.33 degrees fahrenheit) during the past 100 years
the increase is greater in northern latitudes
the ipcc also found that land regions are warming faster than oceans
the ipcc states that most of the temperature increase since the mid-20th century is likely due to human activities
the greenhouse effect human activities contribute to global warming by increasing the greenhouse effect
the greenhouse effect happens when certain gases—known as greenhouse gases—collect in earth’s atmosphere
these gases, which occur naturally in the atmosphere, include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxide, and fluorinated gases sometimes known as chlorofluorocarbons (cfcs)
greenhouse gases let the sun’s light shine onto earth’s surface, but they trap the heat that reflects back up into the atmosphere
in this way, they act like the insulating glass walls of a greenhouse
the greenhouse effect keeps earth’s climate comfortable
without it, surface temperatures would be cooler by about 33 degrees celsius (60 degrees fahrenheit), and many life forms would freeze
since the industrial revolution in the late 1700s and early 1800s, people have been releasing large quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere
that amount has skyrocketed in the past century
greenhouse gas emissions increased 70 percent between 1970 and 2004 
emissions of carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas, rose by about 80 percent during that time
the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today far exceeds the natural range seen over the last 650,000 years
most of the carbon dioxide that people put into the atmosphere comes from burning fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas
cars, trucks, trains, and planes all burn fossil fuels
many electric power plants also burn fossil fuels
another way people release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is by cutting down forests
this happens for two reasons
decaying plant material, including trees, releases tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
living trees absorb carbon dioxide
by diminishing the number of trees to absorb carbon dioxide, the gas remains in the atmosphere
most methane in the atmosphere comes from livestock farming, landfills, and fossil fuel production such as coal mining and natural gas processing
nitrous oxide comes from agricultural technology and fossil fuel burning
fluorinated gases include chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, and hydrofluorocarbons
these greenhouse gases are used in aerosol cans and refrigeration
all of these human activities add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, trapping more heat than usual and contributing to global warming
effects of global warming even slight rises in average global temperatures can have huge effects
perhaps the biggest, most obvious effect is that glaciers and ice caps melt faster than usual
the meltwater drains into the oceans, causing sea levels to rise and oceans to become less salty
ice sheets and glaciers advance and retreat naturally
as earth’s temperature has changed, the ice sheets have grown and shrunk, and sea levels have fallen and risen
ancient corals found on land in florida, bermuda, and the bahamas show that the sea level must have been five to six meters (16-20 feet) higher 130,000 years ago than it is today
earth doesn’t need to become oven-hot to melt the glaciers
northern summers were just three to five degrees celsius (five to nine degrees fahrenheit) warmer during the time of those ancient fossils than they are today
however, the speed at which global warming is taking place is unprecedented
the effects are unknown
glaciers and ice caps cover about 10 percent of the world’s landmass today
they hold about 75 percent of the world’s fresh water
if all of this ice melted, sea levels would rise by about 70 meters (230 feet)
the ipcc reported that the global sea level rose about 1.8 millimeters (0.07 inches) per year from 1961 to 1993, and 3.1 millimeters (0.12 inches) per year since 1993 
rising sea levels could flood coastal communities, displacing millions of people in areas such as bangladesh, the netherlands, and the u.s. state of florida
forced migration would impact not only those areas, but the regions to which the “climate refugees” flee
millions more people in countries like bolivia, peru, and india depend on glacial meltwater for drinking, irrigation, and hydroelectric power
rapid loss of these glaciers would devastate those countries
glacial melt has already raised the global sea level slightly
however, scientists are discovering ways the sea level could increase even faster
for example, the melting of the chacaltaya glacier in bolivia has exposed dark rocks beneath it
the rocks absorb heat from the sun, speeding up the melting process
many scientists use the term “climate change” instead of “global warming.” this is because greenhouse gas emissions affect more than just temperature
another effect involves changes in precipitation like rain and snow
patterns in precipitation may change or become more extreme
over the course of the 20th century, precipitation increased in eastern parts of north and south america, northern europe, and northern and central asia
however, it has decreased in parts of africa, the mediterranean, and parts of southern asia
future changes nobody can look into a crystal ball and predict the future with certainty
however, scientists can make estimates about future population growth, greenhouse gas emissions, and other factors that affect climate
they can enter those estimates into computer models to find out the most likely effects of global warming
the ipcc predicts that greenhouse gas emissions will continue to increase over the next few decades
as a result, they predict the average global temperature will increase by about 0.2 degrees celsius (0.36 degrees fahrenheit) per decade
even if we reduce greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions to their 2000 levels, we can still expect a warming of about 0.1 degree celsius (0.18 degrees fahrenheit) per decade
the panel also predicts global warming will contribute to some serious changes in water supplies around the world
by the middle of the 21st century, the ipcc predicts, river runoff and water availability will most likely increase at high latitudes and in some tropical areas
however, many dry regions in the mid-latitudes and tropics will experience a decrease in water resources
as a result, millions of people may be exposed to water shortages
water shortages decrease the amount of water available for drinking, electricity, and hygiene
shortages also reduce water used for irrigation
agricultural output would slow and food prices would climb
consistent years of drought in the great plains of the united states and canada would have this effect
ipcc data also suggest that the frequency of heat waves and extreme precipitation will increase
weather patterns such as storms and tropical cyclones will become more intense
storms themselves may be stronger, more frequent, and longer-lasting
they would be followed by stronger storm surges, the immediate rise in sea level following storms
storm surges are particularly damaging to coastal areas because their effects (flooding, erosion, damage to buildings and crops) are lasting
what we can do reducing our greenhouse gas emissions is a critical step in slowing the global warming trend
many governments around the world are working toward this goal
the biggest effort so far has been the kyoto protocol, which was adopted in 1997 and went into effect in 2005 
by the end of 2009, 187 countries had signed and ratified the agreement
under the protocol, 37 industrialized countries and the european union have committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions
there are several ways that governments, industries, and individuals can reduce greenhouse gases
we can improve energy efficiency in homes and businesses
we can improve the fuel efficiency of cars and other vehicles
we can also support development of alternative energy sources, such as solar power and biofuels, that don’t involve burning fossil fuels
some scientists are working to capture carbon dioxide and store it underground, rather than let it go into the atmosphere
this process is called carbon sequestration
trees and other plants absorb carbon dioxide as they grow
protecting existing forests and planting new ones can help balance greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
changes in farming practices could also reduce greenhouse gas emissions
for example, farms use large amounts of nitrogen-based fertilizers, which increase nitrogen oxide emissions from the soil
reducing the use of these fertilizers would reduce the amount of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere
the way farmers handle animal manure can also have an effect on global warming
when manure is stored as liquid or slurry in ponds or tanks, it releases methane
when it dries as a solid, however, it does not
reducing greenhouse gas emissions is vitally important
however, the global temperature has already changed and will most likely continue to change for years to come
the ipcc suggests that people explore ways to adapt to global warming as well as try to slow or stop it
some of the suggestions for adapting include:
expanding water supplies through rain catchment, conservation, reuse, and desalination
adjusting crop locations, variety, and planting dates
building seawalls and storm surge barriers and creating marshes and wetlands as buffers against rising sea levels
creating heat-health action plans, boosting emergency medical services, and improving disease surveillance and control
diversifying tourism attractions, because existing attractions like ski resorts and coral reefs may disappear
planning for roads and rail lines to cope with warming and/or flooding
strengthening energy infrastructure, improving energy efficiency, and reducing dependence on single sources of energy

shell shock a sudden increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere does more than change earth's temperature
a lot of the carbon dioxide in the air dissolves into seawater
there, it forms carbonic acid in a process called ocean acidification
ocean acidification is making it hard for some sea creatures to build shells and skeletal structures
this could alter the ecological balance in the oceans and cause problems for fishing and tourism industries

selected text level articlevocabulary the greenhouse effect happens when certain gases, which are known as greenhouse gases, accumulate in earth’s atmosphere
greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (co2), methane (ch4), nitrous oxide (n2o), ozone (o3), and fluorinated gases
greenhouse gases allow the sun’s light to shine onto earth’s surface, and then the gases, such as ozone, trap the heat that reflects back from the surface inside earth’s atmosphere
the gases act like the glass walls of a greenhouse—thus the name, greenhouse gas
according to scientists, the average temperature of earth would drop from 14˚c (57˚f) to as low as –18˚c (–0.4˚f), without the greenhouse effect
some greenhouse gases come from natural sources, for example, evaporation adds water vapor to the atmosphere
animals and plants release carbon dioxide when they respire, or breathe
methane is released naturally from decomposition
there is evidence that suggests methane is released in low-oxygen environments, such as swamps or landfills
volcanoes—both on land and under the ocean—release greenhouse gases, so periods of high volcanic activity tend to be warmer
since the industrial revolution of the late 1700s and early 1800s, people have been releasing larger quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere
that amount has skyrocketed in the past century
greenhouse gas emissions increased 70 percent between 1970 and 2004 
emissions of co2, rose by about 80 percent during that time
the amount of co2 in the atmosphere far exceeds the naturally occurring range seen during the last 650,000 years
most of the co2 that people put into the atmosphere comes from burning fossil fuels
cars, trucks, trains, and planes all burn fossil fuels
many electric power plants do as well
another way humans release co2 into the atmosphere is by cutting down forests, because trees contain large amounts of carbon
people add methane to the atmosphere through livestock farming, landfills, and fossil fuel production such as coal mining and natural gas processing
nitrous oxide comes from agriculture and fossil fuel burning
fluorinated gases include chlorofluorocarbons (cfcs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (hcfcs), and hydrofluorocarbons (hfcs)
they are produced during the manufacturing of refrigeration and cooling products and through aerosols
all of these human activities add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere
as the level of these gases rises, so does the temperature of earth
the rise in earth’s average temperature contributed to by human activity is known as global warming
the greenhouse effect and climate change even slight increases in average global temperatures can have huge effects
perhaps the biggest, most obvious effect is that glaciers and ice caps melt faster than usual
the meltwater drains into the oceans, causing sea levels to rise
glaciers and ice caps cover about 10 percent of the world’s landmasses
they hold between 70 and 75 percent of the world’s freshwater
if all of this ice melted, sea levels would rise by about 70 meters (230 feet)
the intergovernmental panel on climate change states that the global sea level rose about 1.8 millimeters (0.07 inches) per year from 1961 to 1993, and about 3.1 millimeters (0.12 inches) per year since 1993 
rising sea levels cause flooding in coastal cities, which could displace millions of people in low-lying areas such as bangladesh, the u.s. state of florida, and the netherlands
millions more people in countries like bolivia, peru, and india depend on glacial meltwater for drinking, irrigation, and hydroelectric power
rapid loss of these glaciers would devastate those countries
greenhouse gas emissions affect more than just temperature
another effect involves changes in precipitation, such as rain and snow
over the course of the 20th century, precipitation increased in eastern parts of north and south america, northern europe, and northern and central asia
however, it has decreased in parts of africa, the mediterranean, and southern asia
as climates change, so do the habitats for living things
animals that are adapted to a certain climate may become threatened
many human societies depend on predictable rain patterns in order to grow specific crops for food, clothing, and trade
if the climate of an area changes, the people who live there may no longer be able to grow the crops they depend on for survival
some scientists also worry that tropical diseases will expand their ranges into what are now more temperate regions if the temperatures of those areas increase
most climate scientists agree that we must reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere
ways to do this, include:
driving less, using public transportation, carpooling, walking, or riding a bike
flying less—airplanes produce huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions
reducing, reusing, and recycling
planting a tree—trees absorb carbon dioxide, keeping it out of the atmosphere
using less electricity
eating less meat—cows are one of the biggest methane producers
supporting alternative energy sources that don’t burn fossil fuels

overviewvocabulary on december 11, 1997, delegates from more than 150 countries signed the kyoto protocol, an agreement to lower the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere
human activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which have been proven to cause climate change
the kyoto protocol states that industrialized nations will reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to below what they were in 1990 
the kyoto protocol was the first major international effort to slow global climate change
since 1997, 191 countries have backed the agreement, though the united states has not
nations in the developing world are not bound by targets in the kyoto protocol
some of these nations, such as china and brazil, support industrial economies
some developed nations, including the u.s., canada, and russia, have not agreed to emissions targets
perhaps because of its lack of worldwide support, the kyoto protocol has been limited in its success: greenhouse gas output has increased since 1997, not decreased
despite not meeting its goals, kyoto has been significant as a symbol
it was the first step in the process to combat global warming

selected text level articlevocabulary the chesapeake bay is rising
since captain john smith settled what is now the u.s. city of jamestown, virginia, near the shores of the chesapeake in the 1600s, the bay has risen 0.9 meters (three feet)
this rise in sea level has drowned many islands where small fishing communities once thrived
by the end of this century, the chesapeake could rise an additional 0.6 meters (two feet), according to moderate estimates reported by an organization called csspar (pronounced “see-spar”), which stands for chesapeake sea level rise and storm surge: public awareness and response
this partnership, which includes the national geographic society, was started by the conservation fund
csspar works to gather and distribute information about sea level rise and intensified storm surges on the chesapeake bay
polar ice from both greenland and antarctica is melting into the world’s oceans
oceans rise at an average rate of six inches every 100 years
sea level in the chesapeake bay rises at a faster rate than average because the land underneath the bay is sinking
during the last ice age, glaciers pushed the land surrounding the chesapeake bay upward
after the glaciers melted, the land slowly retreated to its original position through a process called land subsidence
as the land sinks, the water in the chesapeake bay rises
land subsidence contributes to about half of the chesapeake region’s observed sea level rise
melting ice causes the remainder
the nation’s estuary
since so much of the land in the chesapeake region already lies very near sea level, even a small rise would have a huge impact
“if an area of land is less than 0.6 meters (two feet) above sea level, and connected to a stream or inlet that is part of the bay, than that area is at risk for what we call ‘inundation’ by rising sea,” explained sean o’connor, a national geographic society cartographic researcher
o’connor created maps for csspar that illustrate the predicted effects of sea level rise on the chesapeake bay
if sea level rise continues on its current path, the bay would invade the land for miles in some places, destroying 167,000 acres of marshland and three million people’s homes by the year 2100 
the chesapeake bay is a precious american resource, “the nation’s estuary,” as o’connor describes it
the u.s. capital, washington, d.c., sits upon the chesapeake watershed
an estuary is an ecosystem where fresh river water pours into the salty ocean, creating a delicate, marshy habitat
hundreds of rivers empty into the chesapeake estuary along the shorelines of six states
around 20 million people live in the chesapeake region
“the shorelines of the chesapeake are flanked with important human infrastructure, like the naval facilities at norfolk, virginia, or the bustling commercial, residential, and tourist districts of baltimore, maryland
and much more area is graced with low-lying wetlands, cypress forests and tidal marshes that are home to countless species of fish, mammals, birds and more
but yet, the estuary finds itself under constant threat of dying out from too much pollution, from overharvesting of species and now from climate change,” o’connor said
sea level rise in the chesapeake bay will destroy the wetland habitats of many birds, fish, shellfish and plants
human populations and structures are also at risk
in many low-lying areas, farms and homes will have to be relocated as the bay floods the land
roads, bridges and buildings will need to be removed and restructured, as will sewage, draining and other utility systems
as the sea creeps inland, rebuilding the infrastructure of major metropolitan areas such as baltimore will be an extremely costly endeavor
storms are brewing
the more acute devastation of sea level rise will threaten the area when storms hit
the region’s cities will be flooded as the ocean surges inland
a higher water level in the bay means stronger storm surges and higher floodwaters
the warm waters of the atlantic ocean can thrust powerful tropical storms and hurricanes into the u.s. east coast, and the low-lying chesapeake region is vulnerable when one of these storms hits
as global warming intensifies, these storms will become more powerful and more frequent
more intense storm surges are already hitting the chesapeake
scientists from csspar compared data from a 1933 storm (the chesapeake-potomac hurricane) to data from a 2003 storm, hurricane isabel
the storms hit the same coastal area with approximately equal force
however, the storm surge from isabel was about 0.3 meters (one foot) higher than the one in 1933 
hurricane isabel's surge was measured at 0.9 to 1.5 meters (three to five feet) above the normal water levels of the chesapeake bay
in the maryland cities of baltimore and annapolis, water was 1.8 to 2.4 meters (six to eight feet) higher than normal
the deadly storm ripped apart buildings and wetlands, caused millions of dollars in damage, downed thousands of trees, and cut off electricity to half a million people for a week
the csspar scientists modeled the impact of a storm like hurricane isabel hitting the chesapeake 70 years in the future, when the sea will be about 0.6 meters (two feet) higher than it is now
the chesapeake bay observing system collected data from shore and marine-based weather stations, and the virginia institute of marine science used this data to simulate and predict future storm surges in the chesapeake region
the results of their modeling showed that flooding would be unprecedented
for instance, isabel caused an 2.4-meter (eight-foot)-high flood in old town alexandria, virginia
add another 0.6 meters (two feet) to the bay, and the flood would be three meters (10 feet) high
in the nation’s capital, several national monuments, navy yards and crucial highways would be covered in deep, muddy water
the resort area of virginia beach, virginia, would be economically damaged
homes, hotels, roads, and islands would be flooded and muddy
though storms will become more powerful and violent, o’connor hopes improved technology will reduce human deaths when future storms hit
such technology can make real-time predictions about the impact of storm surges
satellite imagery and use of global positioning system (gps) coordinates can help people understand the nature of a storm surge, how strong the surge will be, and how long it will last
damage to homes, businesses, or transportation systems could be reduced
“if we continue to improve these models, we won’t necessarily see the same impact on humans [as in past storms] because we would have a better system for educating people,” o’connor said
in other words, this storm prediction technology could save lives
fast fact
the chesapeake's living shorelines to help protect the chesapeake region (in the mid-atlantic region of the united states), average citizens should first educate themselves about the ecology of the chesapeake bay as a system, said sean o'connor, a national geographic society cartographer who has mapped sea-level rise on the chesapeake
o'connor advocates cultivating natural environments along the coast called living shorelines
erosion is controlled by placing rows of stone just off the shoreline, along which aquatic grasses are planted
sand and mud are trapped naturally behind these "walls" of stone and grass
shoreline is actually gained
living shorelines have emerged as the preferred alternative to "hard" techniques such as retaining walls
warming waters as the chesapeake heats up, native species may be forced to migrate

articlevocabulary from the end of a pier jutting into maryland’s patuxent river, scientists at the chesapeake biological laboratory have determined that the region’s water temperatures are warming
according to david secor, a professor from the university of maryland center for environmental science who works at the facility, by 2010 the surface waters at the end of the pier had increased 3°f (1.7°c) since people began collecting data from the site in 1938 
in 2010, secor and his colleagues published an article in the journal estuarine, coastal and shelf science looking at potential impacts of climate change on the chesapeake bay
secor and his colleagues estimate that the chesapeake bay could see increases in water temperature of between 2﻿° to 6°c (3.6° to 10.8°f) by the end of the century
climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperature, precipitation, and other weather patterns
scientists have documented an increase in the average temperature of earth’s air and oceans, known as global warming
the release of carbon emissions into the atmosphere, mostly through industrial agriculture and burning fossil fuels, contributes to global warming
the chesapeake bay is an estuary off the atlantic ocean that stretches north into the u.s. states of virginia and maryland and supports a variety of animal and plant species
more than 100 rivers and streams from new york, delaware, pennsylvania, and west virginia flow into the bay
the plants and animals of the chesapeake bay have supported people since the first european settlers arrived in the area more than 400 years ago
oysters, fish, crabs, and wild rice were part of the diet of the powhatan, the native americans living in the region
chesapeake bay still produces more fish and shellfish than any other estuary in the united states
the blue crab (callinectes sapidus), the “state crustacean” of maryland, is a keystone species in the bay’s food web, as well as one of the area’s most commercially valuable fisheries
though they can only predict what might happen to the region’s ecology and economy as the bay’s temperatures continue to climb, secor and his colleagues think that climate change might cause declines in some fish and shellfish species
some of these species are already stressed by disease and poor water quality
hot water for fishes and plants secor says he suspects that atlantic sturgeon (acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus) and shortnose sturgeon (acipenser brevirostrum) will be affected by the changes in the chesapeake bay
sturgeon are huge fish, native to most rivers that feed the chesapeake bay, including the james and the susquehanna rivers
sturgeon, a cold-water fish also native to russia, are mostly harvested for their eggs, or caviar
sturgeon are a benthic species, meaning they live near the bottom of rivers
sturgeon are particularly sensitive to pollution
runoff from farms and industry, as well as overfishing, have threatened sturgeon populations in the chesapeake bay region
species like sturgeon can also be threatened by warming waters and more frequent droughts
climate change is likely to contribute to these conditions
secor also suspects that fish that thrive in cooler waters, such as striped bass, could experience decreases in population brought about by a warmer climate
“maybe we’ll see higher production of some things like blue crabs, but we may see diminished production of fish that don’t do so well in warmer waters such as striped bass, perch and black sea bass,” he says
according to bill dennison, the vice president for science application at the university of maryland center for environmental science, the chesapeake bay’s rising water temperatures could also change the makeup of the region’s plant communities
he cites an unusually warm summer in 2005 that caused a mass die-off of eelgrass, a marine plant that is commonly found along the mouths of tributaries that flow into the bay from virginia
if eelgrass were to die out in the chesapeake bay due to warming water temperatures, its disappearance would affect other species in the region
for example, some species, such as blue crabs, hide in the eelgrass to molt
when they lose that protection, they are more likely to be caught by predators
according to secor, increasing water temperatures in the bay can also cause species there, including striped bass, shad, and river herring, to misread environmental cues
“these species migrate into the chesapeake bay according to certain reproduction and feeding schedules,” he says
“with warming, those schedules can get miscued due to environmental conditions.”
invasive species the chesapeake bay’s changing water temperatures might affect more than just native plants and animals
the change could also make conditions more favorable for non-native or invasive species
secor points to recent sightings of florida manatees in the chesapeake bay as an example of a species from a warmer climate appearing
florida manatees, an endangered species, are marine mammals primarily found in the warm waters around the florida peninsula and the surrounding southeastern states
more sightings of manatees in the chesapeake bay area could be a sign of the animal moving northward due to changing water conditions
the bay ecosystem, including marine grasses on which manatees feed, may not be able to support the animals
secor and his colleagues identified another invasive species benefitting from warmer bay waters
the parasites that cause the oyster diseases msx and dermo seem to flourish in the warmer and drier conditions that are part of global warming, the latest instance of climate change on earth
reinventing ecosystems secor and his colleagues can make educated guesses, but they can’t say for certain exactly how the chesapeake bay will change as its waters warm
one important variable is how humans respond to climate change
as secor and his colleagues state in a study: “although it is very likely that climate change impacts will occur, it is also clear that the severity of these impacts are directly under human control
efforts to reduce co2 [carbon dioxide] emissions now will thus reduce future climate change impacts on the chesapeake bay and other estuaries.”

though we often think about human-induced climate change as something that will happen in the future, it is an ongoing process
ecosystems and communities in the united states and around the world are being impacted today

global temperatures rose about 1.98°foffsite link (1.1°c) from 1901 to 2020, but climate change refers to more than an increase in temperature
it also includes sea level rise, changes in weather patterns like drought and flooding, and much more
things that we depend upon and value — water, energy, transportation, wildlife, agriculture, ecosystems, and human health — are experiencing the effects of a changing climate
a complex issue the impacts of climate change on different sectors of society are interrelated
drought can harm food production and human health
flooding can lead to disease spread and damages to ecosystems and infrastructure
human health issues can increase mortality, impact food availability, and limit worker productivity
climate change impacts are seen throughout every aspect of the world we live in
however, climate change impacts are uneven across the country and the world — even within a single community, climate change impacts can differ between neighborhoods or individuals
long-standing socioeconomic inequities can make underserved groups, who often have the highest exposure to hazards and the fewest resources to respond, more vulnerable
the projections of a climate change-impacted future are not inevitable
many of the problems and solutionsoffsite link are known to us now, and ongoing research continues to provide new ones
experts believe there is still time to avoid the most negative of outcomes by limiting warmingoffsite link and reducing emissions to zero as quickly as possible
reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases will require investment in new technology and infrastructure, which will spur job growth
additionally, lowering emissions will lessen harmful impacts to human health, saving countless lives and billions of dollars in health-related expenses

our changing climate we see climate change affecting our planet from pole to pole
noaa monitors global climate data and here are some of the changes noaa has recorded
you can explore more at the global climate dashboard
global temperatures rose about 1.8°f (1°c) from 1901 to 2020 
sea level rise has accelerated from 1.7 mm/year throughout most of the twentieth century to 3.2 mm/year since 1993 
glaciers are shrinking: average thickness of 30 well-studied glaciers has decreased more than 60 feet since 1980 
the area covered by sea ice in the arctic at the end of summer has shrunk by about 40% since 1979 
the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen by 25% since 1958, and by about 40% since the industrial revolution
snow is melting earlier compared to long-term averages
water changes to water resources can have a big impact on our world and our lives
flooding is an increasing issue as our climate is changing
compared to the beginning of the 20th century, there are both stronger and more frequent abnormally heavy precipitation events across most of the united states
conversely, drought is also becoming more common, particularly in the western united states
humans are using more water, especially for agriculture
much like we sweat more when it is hot out, higher air temperatures cause plants to lose, or transpire, more water, meaning farmers must give them more water
both highlight the need for more water in places where supplies are dwindling
snowpack is an important source of fresh water for many people
as the snow melts, fresh water becomes available for use, especially in regions like the western united states where there is not much precipitation in warmer months
but as temperatures warm, there is less snow overall and snow begins to melt earlier in the year, meaning snowpack may not be a reliable source of water for the entire warm and dry seasons

colorado students increase community resilience to wildfires the redlands mesa area outside hotchkiss, colorado, is particularly at risk to wildfires, but with funding from noaa’s environmental literacy program, local high school students are taking action to tackle their community’s vulnerability to this hazard
food our food supply depends on climate and weather conditions
although farmers and researchers may be able to adapt some agricultural techniques and technologies or develop new ones, some changes will be difficult to manage
increased temperatures, drought and water stress, diseases, and weather extremes create challenges for the farmers and ranchers who put food on our tables
human farm workers can suffer from heat-related health issues, like exhaustion, heatstroke, and heart attacks
rising temperatures and heat stress can also harm livestock
human health climate change is already impacting human health
changes in weather and climate patterns can put lives at risk
heat is one of the most deadly weather phenomena
as ocean temperatures rise, hurricanes are getting stronger and wetter, which can cause direct and indirect deaths
dry conditions lead to more wildfires, which bring many health risks
higher incidences of flooding can lead to the spread of waterborne diseases, injuries, and chemical hazards
as geographic ranges of mosquitoes and ticks expand, they can carry diseases to new locations
the most vulnerable groups, including children, the elderly, people with preexisting health conditions, outdoor workers, people of color, and people with low income, are at an even higher risk because of the compounding factors from climate change
but public health groups can work with local communities to help people understand and build resilience to climate change health impacts

for full details, visit https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/14/ examples of populations at higher risk of exposure to adverse climate-related health threats are shown along with adaptation measures that can help address disproportionate impacts
when considering the full range of threats from climate change as well as other environmental exposures, these groups are among the most exposed, most sensitive, and have the least individual and community resources to prepare for and respond to health threats
white text indicates the risks faced by those communities, while dark text indicates actions that can be taken to reduce those risks

the environment climate change will continue to have a significant impact on ecosystems and organisms, though they are not impacted equally
the arctic is one of the ecosystems most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, as it is warming at least twice the rate of the global average and melting land ice sheets and glaciers contribute dramaticallyoffsite link to sea level rise around the globe
some living things are able to respond to climate change; some plants are blooming earlier and some species may expand their geographic range
but these changes are happening too fast for many other plants and animals as increasing temperatures and changing precipitation patterns stress ecosystems
some invasive or nuisance species, like lionfish and ticks, may thrive in even more places because of climate change
changes are also occurring in the ocean
the ocean absorbs about 30% of the carbon dioxide that is released into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels
as a result, the water is becoming more acidic, affecting marine life
sea levels are rising due to thermal expansion, in addition to melting ice sheets and glaciers, putting coastal areas at greater risk of erosion and storm surge
the compounding effects of climate change are leading to many changes in ecosystems
coral reefs are vulnerable to many effects of climate change: warming waters can lead to coral bleaching, stronger hurricanes can destroy reefs, and sea level rise can cause corals to be smothered by sediment
coral reef ecosystems are home to thousands of species, which rely on healthy coral reefs to survive

infrastructure physical infrastructure includes bridges, roads, ports, electrical grids, broadband internet, and other parts of our transportation and communication systems
it is often designed to be in use for years or decades, and many communities have infrastructure that was designed without future climate in mind
but even newer infrastructures can be vulnerable to climate change
extreme weather events that bring heavy rains, floods, wind, snow, or temperature changes can stress existing structures and facilities
increased temperatures require more indoor cooling, which can put stress on an energy grid
sudden heavy rainfall can lead to flooding that shuts down highways and major business areas
nearly 40% of the united states population lives in coastal counties, meaning millions of people will be impacted by sea level rise
coastal infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, water supplies, and much more, is at risk
sea level rise can also lead to coastal erosion and high-tide flooding
some communities are projected to possibly end up at or below sea level by 2100 and will face decisions around managed retreat and climate adaptation
many communities are not yet prepared to face climate-related threats
even within a community, some groups are more vulnerable to these threats than others
going forward, it is important for communities to invest in resilient infrastructure that will be able to withstand future climate risks
researchers are studying current and future impacts of climate change on communities and can offer recommendations on best practices
resilience education is vitally important for city planners, emergency managers, educators, communicators, and all other community members to prepare for climate change
flood zones will be easier to predict
the road to resilience noaa sea grant in north carolina partnered with state and local groups to evaluate strategies for coping with inland road flooding during tropical storms and hurricanes
education connection teaching about climate change can be a daunting challenge, but it is a critical field for students to learn about, as it affects many parts of society
the essential principles of climate literacy, developed by noaa and other federal partners, are standards that create a framework for teaching climate
the toolbox for teaching climate & energy explores a learning process to help students engage in climate action in their own communities or on a global scale
for more educator support, noaa offers professional development opportunities (including the planet stewards program) about climate and other topics
s(no)w pain, s(no)w gain: how does el niño affect snowfall over north america?
by michelle l'heureux and brian brettschneider published october 26, 2023 comments: 22 note: the primary writer of this post is michelle l’heureux, but it is inspired by and reviewed by brian brettschneider, who is the nws climate service program manager for the alaska region
the last several winters have been depressingly bleak for snow lovers in the washington, d.c. area, where we at the climate prediction center (cpc) are located
needless to say, when brian brettschneider (@climatologist49) showed me that the d.c. area historically sees above-average snowfall during el niño winters, i excitedly dusted off our sleds and ordered new mittens because we’re expecting an el niño this winter 2023–24
with that said, longtime enso blog readers will know that i’m wish-casting a bit and there’s s(no)w guarantee in this business!
[and, yes, this blog post will include a painful number of snow puns]
el niño nudges the odds in favor of certain climate outcomes, but never ensures them
there have been some d.c. area snow droughts during past el niño winters, and climate change is not our friend
two kids scraping thin snow into snowballs sad children trying to scrape together enough snow to make a snowball in the d.c. area last winter
even worse, they didn’t get a snow day
photo credit: michelle l’heureux
my next question to brian was “what exactly is this snowfall dataset you are using?” as deke arndt (ncei) has noted, collecting historical measurements of snow is a tricky endeavor, fraught with measurement errors, so creating a dataset of sufficient quality for climate studies is hard
but, brian, who is a clever, outside-the-box thinker, realized that the new ecmwf era5 reanalysis dataset may be the ticket (footnote #1)
about five years ago, my colleague at cpc, stephen baxter, published this wildly popular blog post on snow and la niña winters
the only problem is the dataset he used stopped updating in 2009 
thus, we’ve been adrift, snow-wise, until brian pointed us to this new snowfall analysis
so, what does it look like?
s(no)w wonder who are the snowfall winners (or losers) during el niño?
as emily shared with us last month, the jet stream tends to extend eastward and shift southward during el niño winters
you can think of the jet stream as a river of air, which carries more moisture and precipitation along the southern tier of the united states during el niño
as a result, it is not surprising to see a stripe of increased snowfall (blue shading) over the southern half of the country
obviously, snowfall is limited in its southernmost reaches because it needs to be cold enough to snow, so the effects are strongest in the higher and colder elevations of the west
to the north, however, there is a reduction in snowfall (brown shading), especially around the great lakes, interior new england, the northern rockies and pacific northwest, extending through far western canada, and over most of alaska
in fact, el niño appears to be the great snowfall suppressor over most of north america
map of north america snow anomaly patterns during el niño winters snowfall during all el niño winters (january-march) compared to the 1991-2020 average (after the long-term trend has been removed)
blue colors show more snow than average; brown shows less snow than average
noaa climate.gov map, based on era5 data from 1959-2023 analyzed by michelle l'heureux
how about snowfall during moderate-to-strong el niño events like the one expected in winter 2023-24?
in the map below, over many regions, the anomalies become stronger (anomaly = difference from the long-term average), which makes sense because el niño affects the climate
stronger el niño events tend to land a larger punch on our atmosphere, thus increasing the chance of seeing expected el niño impacts

blue colors show more snow than average; brown shows less snow than average
noaa climate.gov map, based on era5 data from 1959-2023 analyzed by michelle l'heureux
snow is flakey while the maps we’ve shown above may excite or depress you depending on your situation and snow preferences, it is very important to recognize that the map is the showing the average of all winters with el niño (footnote #2)
relying on the average is a bit dangerous because a few heavy snowfall winters can give the impression that most winters are above average
which is why it’s important to recognize there can be large variation from winter-to-winter
below is a map showing a count of el niño winters: here, we ask how many of the 13 moderate-to-strong el niño winters had below-average snowfall?
if it is in red shading, that means most winters had below-average snowfall
the deepest reds mean almost all past winters had below-average snowfall (black indicates no snowfall at all, which makes sense if you’re sitting on a beach in south florida)
if it is in grey shading, that means most moderate-to-strong winters had above-average snowfall

red shows locations where more than half the years had below-average snowfall; gray areas below-average snowfall less than half the time
noaa climate.gov map, based on era5 data from 1959-2023 analyzed by michelle l'heureux
s(no)w win situation another major caveat related to these maps is they are just based on snowfall during el niño, and i have removed long-term trends
there is also a trend in snowfall, and it looks like this over north america during january-march
map of north america snow changes over the period 1959-2023 patterns during el niño winters changes in snowfall (in inches per decade) between 1959 and 2023 
across most of the united states—alaska being the major exception—snowfall has declined (brown colors)
noaa climate.gov map, based on era5 data from 1959-2023 analyzed by michelle l'heureux
unsurprisingly, because of climate change, over most of the contiguous united states we have trended toward less snowy winters
this doesn’t mean that it never snows, or we cannot get big snowstorms (footnote #3), but that snowfall has gradually trended downward over time
in contrast, wintertime snowfall may have actually increased somewhat over time over the colder northern latitudes of alaska and parts of canada (this trend reverses in the spring; see footnote #4)
why would that be the case?
well, if you think about it, the warming of our planet allows the air to hold more moisture
if the atmospheric circulation allows for it, then that moisture can be wrung out of the air and precipitate
snowfall also depends on the air temperature remaining below the freezing point
at more northern latitudes, despite warming air temperatures, it still remains cold enough in the winter to fall as snow
but there is no such luck in more southern locations which are often closer to the freezing point
there, the tendency toward warmer winters is a snow killer
so, will the expected pattern of el ni-s(ño)w pan out for us this winter?
time will tell, but in the meantime, it is fun to imagine the possibilities
footnotes (1) we have to be careful to not take any one dataset literally, but this ecmwf era5 data seems to pass a few sniff tests
sniff test #1 was “does era5 snowfall reproduce the winter pattern of snowfall made with other datasets?” the answer, at least when comparing with winter 2022-23, is yes
sniff test #2 was “does era5 snowfall reproduce the historical enso pattern that is found within other datasets?” here again, the answer is yes, we were able to reproduce enso composite maps that were made with the rutgers gridded snow data in this older enso blog post
sniff test #3 was comparing with our old enso snowfall composites made from an even older (not quality controlled) station-based dataset that has been discontinued
with that said, era5 is a newer dataset, it is “reanalysis,” which means that a very short-range weather model is used to produce snowfall from in situ observations (from the ecmwf website, it outputs the “mass of snow that has fallen to the earth’s surface”)
essentially a reanalysis is predicting what observed snowfall would have looked like based on past observational inputs from satellites, stations, buoys, and other observing systems
therefore, we recommend you treat some of the finer details with a healthy degree of suspicion and try to corroborate them in other datasets
hopefully this blog post will motivate the creation of additional snowfall datasets and scientists will explore how well era5 compares with these other snowfall measurements
(2) brian emphasizes that composites (average historical maps during el niño) are retrospectives and they are not a forecast
a forecast takes in account conditions beyond just el niño, such as long-term climate trends, soil moisture, sea ice, and other global boundary forcings
(3) in fact, because a warmer atmosphere carries more moisture, there is published evidence that extreme snowfall events can intensify as a response to global warming (e.g

august 2023 was earth’s hottest august in noaa’s 174-year climate record
the sizzling month also wrapped up the northern hemisphere’s warmest meteorological summer and the southern hemisphere’s warmest meteorological winter on record, according to an analysis by scientists from noaa’s national centers for environmental information
“this analysis highlights the suite of climate services provided by noaa, which informs a climate-ready nation,” said noaa chief scientist dr. sarah kapnick
“not only was last month the warmest august on record by quite a lot, it was also the globe’s 45th-consecutive august and the 534th-consecutive month with temperatures above the 20th-century average
global marine heat waves and a growing el niño are driving additional warming this year, but as long as emissions continue driving a steady march of background warming, we expect further records to be broken in the years to come.”
following is a closer look at noaa’s latest monthly global climate report:
climate by the numbers
august 2023 
the average global land and ocean surface temperature in august was 2.25 degrees f (1.25 degrees c) above the 20th-century average of 60.1 degrees f (15.6 degrees c), ranking as the warmest august in the 174-year global climate record
four continents — africa, asia, north america and south america — had their warmest augusts on record, while europe and oceania both saw their second-warmest august on record
august 2023 was the arctic region’s warmest august on record
for the fifth-consecutive month, the global sea surface temperature hit a record high for the month
in fact, august 2023 set a record for the highest monthly sea surface temperature anomaly (1.85 degrees f, or 1.03 degrees c, higher than normal) of any month in noaa’s climate record
season (june-august 2023) | year to date (ytd, january-august 2023) 
the june–august 2023 global surface temperature was 2.07 degrees f (1.15 degrees c) above the 20th-century average of 60.1 degrees f (15.6 degrees c)
this ranks as the warmest june–august period in the 174-year record, and 0.43 of a degree (0.24 of a degree c) above the previous record
the past 10 june–august periods are the 10-warmest such periods on record
june-august 2023 was also the northern hemisphere’s hottest meteorological summer on record, at 2.59 degrees f (1.44 degrees c) above average
the season, which also marks the southern hemisphere’s winter, was the southern hemisphere’s warmest winter on record at 1.53 degrees f (0.85 of a degree c) above average
globally, the ytd ranked as the second-warmest such ytd ever recorded, at 1.55 degrees f (0.86 of a degree c) above the 20th-century average of 57.3 degrees f (14.0 degrees c)
according to ncei’s global annual temperature outlook and data through august, there is a 95% chance that 2023 will rank among the world’s two warmest years on record

august 2023 had the lowest global august sea ice extent on record: globally, sea ice extent (coverage) in august 2023 was about 550,000 square miles less than the previous record low from august 2019 
sea ice extent in antarctica continued to track at record lows — antarctica saw its fourth-consecutive month with the lowest sea ice extent on record
six of the first eight months in 2023 have seen antarctic sea ice extent at record-breaking low levels
the tropics were active in august: nineteen named storms occurred across the globe in august 2023, which is tied for the third most for august since 1981 
eight of those reached major tropical cyclone strength (sustained winds of 111 mph or higher), which ties august 2015 for the most august storms on record
the atlantic, with six storms in august including two hurricanes, had activity that was considered above normal by all metrics
the east pacific basin saw six named storms, including three major hurricanes, while the west pacific saw seven storms, six of which became typhoons
if this year’s weather is statistically “normal,” most locations in the contiguous united states will experience their hottest day of the year between july 15-31. for another significant chunk of the country—including most of alaska—the historical window for the hottest day of the year has already passed
this map shows the average window for the day of the year with the highest maximum temperature based on the 1991-2020 u.s. climate normals, the nation’s official record of recent climate
the colors show date ranges progressing from june 1 (lightest yellow) through september 30 (darkest red)
the darker the color, the later in the year the hottest day typically arrives
for most of the country, the warmest day occurs sometime between mid-july and mid-august
the amount of solar radiation reaching earth (in the northern hemisphere) peaks at the summer solstice on june 21, but temperatures tend to keep increasing into july
the continued warming occurs because the rate of heat input from the sun during the day continues to be greater than the cooling at night for several weeks past the solstice, until temperatures start to descend in late july and early august
the lightest and darkest areas of the map show just how variable the u.s. climate can be
the lightest colors (earliest warmest day) occur in new mexico and arizona
this early arrival reflects the influence of the north american monsoon, a period of increased rainfall affecting the u.s. southwest in mid-to-late summer
the region’s highest temperatures tend to occur in june, before the monsoon’s clouds and rain set in
the darkest colors occur along the pacific coastline, where the persistence of the marine layer—a persistent layer of clouds that forms above the chilly coastal waters—maintains cool temperatures in early summer
in many locations, the warmest days on average do not occur until september when the fog lifts
the national centers for environmental information (ncei) warmest day of the year maps are derived from the 1991-2020 u.s. climate normals, 30-year averages of climatological variables including the average high temperature for every day
temperature normals are important indicators that are used in forecasting and monitoring by many u.s. economic sectors
knowing the probability of high temperatures can help energy companies prepare for rising electricity demand and help farmers monitor heat-sensitive crops
they are also useful planning tools for the healthcare, construction, and tourism industries
you may even want to check the normals at your destination as part of any advance planning your next event or vacation
of course, any single year’s hottest day may arrive earlier or later than the normal window, depending on the short-term weather

major flood outburst from mendenhall glacier in alaska not possible without climate change by haley thiem reviewed by rick thoman and andrew park published august 14, 2023 reset map share facebook twitter envelope print related content an outburst flood from a glacial meltwater lake sent record amounts of water into mendenhall lake and down mendenhall river toward juneau, alaska, between august 4 and august 6, 2023 
significant flooding was reported in areas along the river that have not seen flooding from these types of events in the past, the national weather service (nws) office in juneau said
flood waters swept trees and buildings into the river as significant erosion occurred
satellite image of alaska around juneau the mendenhall glacier fills a large valley north of juneau, alaska, and creates an ice dam for a meltwater lake that fills suicide basin
since 2011, outburst floods from the depression have been pouring into mendenhall lake and rushing down the river toward juneau on a yearly basis
noaa climate.gov image, based on landsat satellite data from may 20, 2019 
“decades worth of erosion happened in one weekend,” rick thoman, alaska climate specialist at the alaska center for climate assessment and policy told climate.gov
“the buildings that fell into the river and those that are uninhabitable now, were not right next to the river on friday afternoon.”
the mendenhall lake gauge crested at 14.97 feet august 5 around 11:15 pm akdt, smashing the previous record by nearly 3 feet (11.99 feet in july 2016) and exceeding the initial forecast of 12.3 feet from the alaska-pacific river forecast center in coordination with nws juneau
at the height of this event, the united states geological survey (usgs) gauge at mendenhall lake recorded a streamflow of 25,200 cubic feet per second (cfs), which is “historic,” andrew park, a meteorologist at nws juneau told climate.gov
according to usgs data the previous maximum streamflow only reached 16,300 cfs in 2016 
line graphs of the peak streamflow during the previous record-high flood, in 2016, and the much bigger peak flow during the august 2023 event streamflow at mendenhall lake during the previous record-high outburst flood, in 2016 (blue line), and during the much larger event on august 4-6, 2023 (orange line)
in 2016, the lake in suicide basin drained several times, though later events were smaller
noaa climate.gov image, based on data from the u.s. geological survey
park went on to put the numbers into perspective, saying that a streamflow of 17,100 cfs has 1% chance of occurring in a given year and a streamflow of 26,000 cfs has a 0.2% chance of occurring in a given year, based off of data from a 2020 fema flood insurance study
a flood so extreme that it has only a 0.2 percent chance of happening each year is sometimes called a “1-in-500-year flood.” but a 1-in-500-year event does not mean that these events can only happen once every 500 years, just that over long periods of time, the average return frequency would be every 500 years
the flooding following this outburst was equivalent to a 500-year event through the mendenhall valley
*
this event released a torrent of water downstream from the suicide basin, into the mendenhall valley, which is juneau’s most heavily populated neighborhood, according to the alaska coastal rainforest center (acrc)
over two days in early august, a glacial lake on a tributary of the mendenhall glacier burst through its ice dam and drained into the mendenhall river
time-lapse images from a remote camera captured the dramatic drop in lake levels

“without climate change, there is no reason to think that this would be happening on the mendenhall glacier, then in the lake, and downriver,” thoman said
climate change and glacier retreat in alaska alaska has warmed twice as fast as the rest of the united states over the last several decades
over the last century alaska’s average annual temperature has risen 3.1 degrees fahrenheit and the overall trend continues to increase, according to data from noaa’s national centers for environmental information
scientists have attributed the retreat, melting, and thinning of glaciers over the last century to earth’s warming climate
alaska’s glaciers are among the fastest melting glaciers on earth and have been in steep decline since the late 1980s, according to the alaska climate science center (ak csc)
not every retreating glacier in alaska is at risk for these glacial lake outburst floods, but those that are can have very serious consequences downstream
these floods can happen in different ways, but all begin with a lake of meltwater or rainwater runoff that is blocked from draining by an ice dam
when the dam breaks, the lake can suddenly drain in a massive pulse
for the mendenhall valley, glacial lake outburst floods are a relatively new phenomena but have become a yearly occurrence since 2011, when the first outburst occurred
over the last century, suicide basin has changed drastically due to thinning, melting, and glacial retreat
suicide glacier, pictured below, was once much larger
a frozen tributary, it flowed into and merged with the mendenhall glacier
the photo below, from the alaska climate adaptation science center (ak casc), shows how suicide glacier has shrunk over a 125-period from 1893 to 2018 
timelapse photos showing the retreat of the mendenhall and suicide glaciers between 1893 and 2018 two photos taken more than a century apart show the retreat of the mendenhall and suicide glaciers between 1893 (top) and 2018 (bottom)
suicide glacier has retreated up onto a ridge
a meltwater lake now fills the lower basin, dammed by the mendenhall glacier
photos from the alaska climate adaptation science center
what is also seen in the picture is a rather large valley or bowl, known as a topographic depression, that has been carved out of this mountainous area where suicide glacier once was
this bowl now contains leftover ice from when the glacier retreated, ice from calving events of the mendenhall glacier, and any additional water that drains into the basin
throughout the warm season, snowmelt, rainfall, and glacial meltwater fills the depression within suicide basin, which is naturally dammed by mendenhall glacier, creating a glacial lake
outbursts occur when this water and ice dammed by the mendenhall glacier is suddenly released and flows downstream
although human-caused global warming is the reason that these floods are occurring at all, there are many other factors that determine when and where any given year’s flood will occur and how big it will be
monitoring and predicting glacial lake outburst floods in alaska since 2011, scientists from noaa’s nws, university of alaska southeast, the usgs, and the city of juneau have been investigating the region intensely to determine how much water this basin can hold, at what point does the dam give way to these outbursts, the frequency of these events per year and any downstream impacts
similar research is underway in many other alaska watersheds that now harbor glacial lakes
as of august 9, 2023, suicide basin has started to refill but remains at very low levels, according to the nws
scientists will continue to monitor the conditions within the basin as it fills into the fall season
just last year, there was a secondary release from the basin in october, the nws noted
scientists are still actively running surveys as this area continues to change and a post-event survey will come out in the coming weeks
keep checking back; we will have additional updates as scientists’ understanding of the event evolves
noaa employs climate adaptation and resilience techniques to save florida corals from this summer's record-long marine heat wave by haley thiem reviewed by ian enochs published september 26, 2023 reset map more in this event noaa and partners race to rescue remaining florida corals from historic ocean heat wave july 28, 2023 share facebook twitter envelope print related content this summer, portions of the florida keys experienced an extreme marine heat wave
the cumulative heat stress to area corals was nearly triple the previous record
(see data for individual locations throughout the keys.)
in response to this heat wave, the coral reefs located in the keys experienced an unprecedented amount of bleaching—expelling their partner algae and risking starvation
during dives on july 31 and august 1, noaa scientists found the cheeca rocks reef in the keys completely bleached
the widespread extent of the bleaching at this location shocked scientists, who have spent over a decade studying the corals there

marine heat waves and global warming the ocean is storing an estimated 91 percent of the excess heat energy trapped in the earth’s climate system by human-produced greenhouse gases
recent studies (in nature and science) indicate that marine heat waves over the past century are becoming longer and more frequent, and these trends are expected to continue as the oceans continue to warm due to human-induced climate change
experts have also implicated global warming as a major influence in specific events, including a 2021 northwest pacific marine heat wave that coincided with the summer olympics in japan and a 2015/16 marine heat wave in the tasman sea
they have even concluded that some individual marine heat waves would not have been possible in a pre-industrial climate
coral reefs worldwide are facing a serious threat to their existence due to these extreme heat events and ocean acidification (the drop in ocean water ph as it absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide)
it is becoming increasingly important for scientists to track, monitor, and respond to how the ocean’s climate is changing as this can have great consequences for the life, ecosystems and biodiversity of these regions
we spoke with ian enochs about some of these efforts
enochs is the lead of the coral program at the atlantic oceanographic and meteorological laboratory’s (aoml) and principal investigator for climate monitoring in the western atlantic and caribbean as part of the noaa’s national coral reef monitoring program (ncrmp), a coordinated cross-ocean effort for monitoring coral reefs in u.s. jurisdictions
ian enochs dives at cheeca rocks in late july and early august, enochs (pictured here) and his team dove at cheeca rocks and found it severely bleached

“we monitor temperature and carbon dioxide levels to characterize the acidification of coral reefs
we also measure coral cover and their ability to produce habitat, which are linked both to warming as well as acidification,” enochs said
“the reason we focus on these things, in particular the habitat formation and production, is because that reef framework is ultimately what is responsible for all of the ecosystem services that we rely on
the storm surge protection, the diving, fisheries, all of the remarkable biodiversity depends on that habitat
without it, those services disappear.”
he went on to explain as ocean acidification progresses, it increases the rate at which the habitat erodes, also known as bioerosion, which slows down the growth of coral eventually leading to a net loss in that habitat
“this is why we are so laser focused on these processes and the progression of climate.”
adaptation and resilience strategies there are several different adaptation and resilience strategies that noaa scientists are engaged in and studying while this year’s coral bleaching event persists
1. data coordination “one the things we are involved with is data coordination
we have created tools for sharing data across different existing coral nurseries with different state, government, academic, and nonprofit partners as they grow different coral individuals for restoration,” enochs said
“we compile this data and compare it across different genotypes and individuals so we have a good understanding of what the performance of a specific genotype or individual is.”
he compared it to planting a garden, saying if you have a full-sun garden you would not want to plant a shade-loving species there, as they would not be capable of thriving under sunny conditions
it is similar with corals: his team compiles and compares data to see what conditions certain corals will thrive under
2. strengthening resilience enochs and his team are also conducting different experiments to test and perhaps strengthen the resilience of corals within their labs
“we are also involved with the evaluation of stress-hardening techniques
one of the multiple ways we have been investigating is looking at how environmental variability, specifically intermittent exposure to [heat] stress, can lead to greater thermal tolerance,” enochs said
“we are focused on using natural mechanisms of resilience
for instance, in the wild, corals that have been in tidal pools that get really hot during the day and cool down at night, can be more thermal tolerant
we want to know if we can effectively operationalize that and make it a tool for making corals more tolerant to stress.”

twice a day they shocked the corals in the lab by subjecting them to higher temperatures, followed by more tolerable conditions and found that after some time the corals were able to better withstand longer-term temperature stress
he cautions that although this tool has shown some degree of success, it is not a silver bullet and needs to be integrated into a larger restoration approach
the researchers are also looking into how nutrition may be used to fatten corals up before a heat stress event in order to make them more capable of dealing with stressful events better
so far, this technique is one that needs additional evaluation in a lab setting before being utilized on a wild reef
3. automation and expansion enochs explained his team and many other scientists across the world’s reefs are also working on automation and robotics in terms of how they can be more efficient in the coral restoration process
“the scale of the problem that we are dealing with is one that is not simply going to be addressed by people growing things on a small scale, so we are interested in techniques to scale up production [of resilient corals for transplanting].”
4. relocation and shading in a noaa media call in august, andy bruckner, a research coordinator with noaa’s florida keys national marine sanctuary, outlined additional practices that were being done this year
one of which was relocating coral nurseries from shallow waters to deeper and cooler waters offshore
they were also conducting some pilot interventions, like small scale shading experiments on land based coral production facilities as well as in the great barrier reef among other locations
bruckner explained that the shading is meant to reduce light, not temperature
“what we have seen is when these corals are exposed to really high temperature stress, if there is a compounding impact from high light level, that tends to make bleaching much more severe.”
these techniques represent just a fraction of some of the ongoing efforts to try to study and save these coral reefs in a time of record heat and unprecedented bleaching
a little help from nature one event in recent weeks that has helped out the florida keys coral reefs was hurricane idalia
idalia tracked across the gulf of mexico, just west of the keys while rapidly intensifying
the hurricane utilized the extremely warm sea surface temperatures in the area to gather strength but in doing so left behind a wake of much cooler water
“hurricane idalia caused strong cooling of the entirety of florida’s coral reef and pushed temperatures below the bleaching threshold for the first time since late june/early july,” derek manzello, coordinator of noaas coral reef watch program said
“the storm effectively cooled sea surface temperatures around the florida keys by 1.7 degrees fahrenheit (0.92 celsius).”
coral bleaching hot spots before and after hurricane idalia (left) in late august, before hurricane idalia, much of the water surrounding florida and the keys was experiencing departures from average temperature high enough to cause heat stress
(right) in early september, after hurricane idalia, many cooled below heat stress values
these images are based on the noaa coral reef watch daily global 5km coral bleaching hotspot product
values of 1 °c or more indicate heat stress capable of causing coral bleaching, while values less than 1 °c indicate no heat stress
noaa climate.gov image, based on coral reef watch data
enochs’ team returned to cheeca rocks in mid-september and while they did observe some dead coral colonies, they also saw color returning to some of the colonies that had bleached earlier this summer
“this is wonderful news and is definitely associated with the cooler water conditions we have been experiencing
it does not, however, mean that we are out of the woods,” enochs warned
he explained that during past bleaching events a lot of mortality occurred after the fact, with weakened corals being consumed by disease
additionally, he noted that bleaching and thermal stress can lead to other issues with growth and reproduction down the line, even if the corals do not die
unfortunately, this cooling was short-lived and by mid-september sea surface temperature anomalies already rebounded to 2 to 4 degrees celsius above normal
this has prompted a level 2 bleaching alert to return to the keys, meaning that severe bleaching and significant mortality continues to be likely, according to noaas coral reef watch
hope remains this year has been an incredibly tough year for many coral reefs globally, but especially those near florida and in the caribbean
for enochs and other scientists, this cause is deeply personal
“i have never seen people so motivated to do positive good to restore these reefs and make sure that we are not losing the last reefs that we have
in the face of all this doom and gloom, we still need to hold on to some hope,” enochs said
“we all can, we all have to work together to lower our carbon footprint
the problem is big enough that it will not be solved by a single individual, rather we all need to tackle this together at scale.”
how do we know climate change is really happening?
climate change is often cast as a prediction made by complicated computer models
but the scientific basis for climate change is much broader, and models are actually only one part of it (and, for what it’s worth, they’re surprisingly accurate)

for more than a century, scientists have understood the basic physics behind why greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide cause warming
these gases make up just a small fraction of the atmosphere but exert outsized control on earth’s climate by trapping some of the planet’s heat before it escapes into space
this greenhouse effect is important: it’s why a planet so far from the sun has liquid water and life!
however, during the industrial revolution, people started burning coal and other fossil fuels to power factories, smelters and steam engines, which added more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere
ever since, human activities have been heating the planet
we know this is true thanks to an overwhelming body of evidence that begins with temperature measurements taken at weather stations and on ships starting in the mid-1800s
later, scientists began tracking surface temperatures with satellites and looking for clues about climate change in geologic records
together, these data all tell the same story: earth is getting hotter
average global temperatures have increased by 2.2 degrees fahrenheit, or 1.2 degrees celsius, since 1880, with the greatest changes happening in the late 20th century
land areas have warmed more than the sea surface and the arctic has warmed the most — by more than 4 degrees fahrenheit just since the 1960s
temperature extremes have also shifted
in the united states, daily record highs now outnumber record lows two-to-one

a famous illustration, first published in 1998 and often called the hockey-stick graph, shows how temperatures remained fairly flat for centuries (the shaft of the stick) before turning sharply upward (the blade)
it’s based on data from tree rings, ice cores and other natural indicators
and the basic picture, which has withstood decades of scrutiny from climate scientists and contrarians alike, shows that earth is hotter today than it’s been in at least 1,000 years, and probably much longer

in fact, surface temperatures actually mask the true scale of climate change, because the ocean has absorbed 90 percent of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases
measurements collected over the last six decades by oceanographic expeditions and networks of floating instruments show that every layer of the ocean is warming up
according to one study, the ocean has absorbed as much heat between 1997 and 2015 as it did in the previous 130 years
we also know that climate change is happening because we see the effects everywhere
ice sheets and glaciers are shrinking while sea levels are rising
arctic sea ice is disappearing
in the spring, snow melts sooner and plants flower earlier
animals are moving to higher elevations and latitudes to find cooler conditions
and droughts, floods and wildfires have all gotten more extreme
models predicted many of these changes, but observations show they are now coming to pass

how much agreement is there among scientists about climate change?
there’s no denying that scientists love a good, old-fashioned argument
but when it comes to climate change, there is virtually no debate: numerous studies have found that more than 90 percent of scientists who study earth’s climate agree that the planet is warming and that humans are the primary cause
most major scientific bodies, from nasa to the world meteorological organization, endorse this view
that’s an astounding level of consensus given the contrarian, competitive nature of the scientific enterprise, where questions like what killed the dinosaurs remain bitterly contested
scientific agreement about climate change started to emerge in the late 1980s, when the influence of human-caused warming began to rise above natural climate variability
by 1991, two-thirds of earth and atmospheric scientists surveyed for an early consensus study said that they accepted the idea of anthropogenic global warming
and by 1995, the intergovernmental panel on climate change, a famously conservative body that periodically takes stock of the state of scientific knowledge, concluded that “the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate.” currently, more than 97 percent of publishing climate scientists agree on the existence and cause of climate change (as does nearly 60 percent of the general population of the united states)
climate fwd a new administration, an ongoing climate emergency — and a ton of news
our newsletter will help you stay on top of it

so where did we get the idea that there’s still debate about climate change?
a lot of it came from coordinated messaging campaigns by companies and politicians that opposed climate action
many pushed the narrative that scientists still hadn’t made up their minds about climate change, even though that was misleading
frank luntz, a republican consultant, explained the rationale in an infamous 2002 memo to conservative lawmakers: “should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly,” he wrote
questioning consensus remains a common talking point today, and the 97 percent figure has become something of a lightning rod
to bolster the falsehood of lingering scientific doubt, some people have pointed to things like the global warming petition project, which urged the united states government to reject the kyoto protocol of 1997, an early international climate agreement
the petition proclaimed that climate change wasn’t happening, and even if it were, it wouldn’t be bad for humanity
since 1998, more than 30,000 people with science degrees have signed it
however, nearly 90 percent of them studied something other than earth, atmospheric or environmental science, and the signatories included just 39 climatologists
most were engineers, doctors, and others whose training had little to do with the physics of the climate system

a few well-known researchers remain opposed to the scientific consensus
some, like willie soon, a researcher affiliated with the harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics, have ties to the fossil fuel industry
others do not, but their assertions have not held up under the weight of evidence
at least one prominent skeptic, the physicist richard muller, changed his mind after reassessing historical temperature data as part of the berkeley earth project
his team’s findings essentially confirmed the results he had set out to investigate, and he came away firmly convinced that human activities were warming the planet
“call me a converted skeptic,” he wrote in an op-ed for the times in 2012 
mr. luntz, the republican pollster, has also reversed his position on climate change and now advises politicians on how to motivate climate action
a final note on uncertainty: denialists often use it as evidence that climate science isn’t settled
however, in science, uncertainty doesn’t imply a lack of knowledge
rather, it’s a measure of how well something is known
in the case of climate change, scientists have found a range of possible future changes in temperature, precipitation and other important variables — which will depend largely on how quickly we reduce emissions
but uncertainty does not undermine their confidence that climate change is real and that people are causing it
hope and despair on a boiling planet as efforts to control climate change are on the rise across the globe, the challenges are steeper than ever

this article is part of our special section on the climate forward event that will include policy and climate leaders from around the world
on any given day, there is good reason to be both exceedingly optimistic about the progress being made to combat climate change, and also deeply concerned about the threats presented by a rapidly warming planet
take a single wednesday last month: aug. 16. on that day, the white house celebrated the first anniversary of the signing of the inflation reduction act
president biden’s signature climate legislation is providing hundreds of billions of dollars to subsidize the build-out of clean energy around the country, turbocharging efforts to shift the economy away from planet-warming fossil fuels
at the very same time, however, a flurry of extreme weather events were battering the globe
hurricane hilary, which would go on to lash southern california as a rare tropical storm, formed in the pacific ocean
portland and other cities in the northwest united states were sizzling under an unusual heat wave
and japan was cleaning up from a destructive typhoon

on the one hand, a new green revolution is genuinely underway, with trillions of dollars being spent to reduce planet-warming emissions
on the other hand, the destructive effects of climate change are now squarely upon us, and poised to get worse, scientists predict
“the basis for both the hope and the fear has increased,” al gore, the former vice president, said in an interview
“that may sound like a paradox, but i’ve never been more hopeful that we are going to solve this crisis, and there’s never been clearer evidence of how rapidly this crisis is getting much worse, faster than expected.”
latest news on climate change and the environment card 1 of 5 forests and carbon capture
restoring global forests where they naturally occur could potentially capture an additional 226 gigatons of planet-warming carbon, according to a new study
but scientists warned that the outcome couldn’t be achieved without cutting greenhouse gas emissions
ominous signs
greenland’s mountain glaciers and floating ice shelves are melting faster than they were just a few decades ago and becoming destabilized, according to two separate studies
the findings are particularly significant as ice melting into the ocean from greenland is one of the biggest contributors to global sea level rise
a hot year
a data analysis by european climate scientists found that october 2023 was the warmest october on record globally, on the heels of the hottest september on record
the findings round out a year of rising temperatures that is projected to be the hottest one on record
a new wildfire risk
forest fires may get more attention, but a new study reveals that grassland fires are more widespread and destructive across the united states
almost every year since 1990, the study found, grass and shrub fires burned more land than forest fires did, and they destroyed more homes, too
dire warnings
global warming may be happening more quickly than previously thought, according to a new study by a group of researchers that included former nasa scientist james hansen, whose testimony before congress 35 years ago helped raise broad awareness of climate change
it’s this tension — between progress and inertia, between a sustainable future and an untenable status quo — that will animate a full day of live journalism at the new york times climate forward event on thursday
timed to coincide with the united nations general assembly session in new york city, the event will feature conversations with mr. gore; prime minister jonas gahr store of norway; president william ruto of kenya; bill gates, a founder of microsoft and the founder of breakthrough energy; the tidying-up expert and author marie kondo; the former environmental protection agency administrator gina mccarthy; and many other climate leaders

how do we know climate change is really happening?
climate change is often cast as a prediction made by complicated computer models
but the scientific basis for climate change is much broader, and models are actually only one part of it (and, for what it’s worth, they’re surprisingly accurate)

for more than a century, scientists have understood the basic physics behind why greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide cause warming
these gases make up just a small fraction of the atmosphere but exert outsized control on earth’s climate by trapping some of the planet’s heat before it escapes into space
this greenhouse effect is important: it’s why a planet so far from the sun has liquid water and life!
however, during the industrial revolution, people started burning coal and other fossil fuels to power factories, smelters and steam engines, which added more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere
ever since, human activities have been heating the planet
we know this is true thanks to an overwhelming body of evidence that begins with temperature measurements taken at weather stations and on ships starting in the mid-1800s
later, scientists began tracking surface temperatures with satellites and looking for clues about climate change in geologic records
together, these data all tell the same story: earth is getting hotter
average global temperatures have increased by 2.2 degrees fahrenheit, or 1.2 degrees celsius, since 1880, with the greatest changes happening in the late 20th century
land areas have warmed more than the sea surface and the arctic has warmed the most — by more than 4 degrees fahrenheit just since the 1960s
temperature extremes have also shifted

in fact, surface temperatures actually mask the true scale of climate change, because the ocean has absorbed 90 percent of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases
measurements collected over the last six decades by oceanographic expeditions and networks of floating instruments show that every layer of the ocean is warming up
according to one study, the ocean has absorbed as much heat between 1997 and 2015 as it did in the previous 130 years
we also know that climate change is happening because we see the effects everywhere
ice sheets and glaciers are shrinking while sea levels are rising
arctic sea ice is disappearing
in the spring, snow melts sooner and plants flower earlier
animals are moving to higher elevations and latitudes to find cooler conditions
and droughts, floods and wildfires have all gotten more extreme

how much agreement is there among scientists about climate change?
there’s no denying that scientists love a good, old-fashioned argument
but when it comes to climate change, there is virtually no debate: numerous studies have found that more than 90 percent of scientists who study earth’s climate agree that the planet is warming and that humans are the primary cause
most major scientific bodies, from nasa to the world meteorological organization, endorse this view
that’s an astounding level of consensus given the contrarian, competitive nature of the scientific enterprise, where questions like what killed the dinosaurs remain bitterly contested
scientific agreement about climate change started to emerge in the late 1980s, when the influence of human-caused warming began to rise above natural climate variability
by 1991, two-thirds of earth and atmospheric scientists surveyed for an early consensus study said that they accepted the idea of anthropogenic global warming
and by 1995, the intergovernmental panel on climate change, a famously conservative body that periodically takes stock of the state of scientific knowledge, concluded that “the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate.” currently, more than 97 percent of publishing climate scientists agree on the existence and cause of climate change (as does nearly 60 percent of the general population of the united states)

so where did we get the idea that there’s still debate about climate change?
a lot of it came from coordinated messaging campaigns by companies and politicians that opposed climate action
many pushed the narrative that scientists still hadn’t made up their minds about climate change, even though that was misleading
frank luntz, a republican consultant, explained the rationale in an infamous 2002 memo to conservative lawmakers: “should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly,” he wrote
questioning consensus remains a common talking point today, and the 97 percent figure has become something of a lightning rod
to bolster the falsehood of lingering scientific doubt, some people have pointed to things like the global warming petition project, which urged the united states government to reject the kyoto protocol of 1997, an early international climate agreement
the petition proclaimed that climate change wasn’t happening, and even if it were, it wouldn’t be bad for humanity
since 1998, more than 30,000 people with science degrees have signed it
however, nearly 90 percent of them studied something other than earth, atmospheric or environmental science, and the signatories included just 39 climatologists
most were engineers, doctors, and others whose training had little to do with the physics of the climate system

a few well-known researchers remain opposed to the scientific consensus
some, like willie soon, a researcher affiliated with the harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics, have ties to the fossil fuel industry
others do not, but their assertions have not held up under the weight of evidence
at least one prominent skeptic, the physicist richard muller, changed his mind after reassessing historical temperature data as part of the berkeley earth project
his team’s findings essentially confirmed the results he had set out to investigate, and he came away firmly convinced that human activities were warming the planet
“call me a converted skeptic,” he wrote in an op-ed for the times in 2012 
mr. luntz, the republican pollster, has also reversed his position on climate change and now advises politicians on how to motivate climate action
a final note on uncertainty: denialists often use it as evidence that climate science isn’t settled
however, in science, uncertainty doesn’t imply a lack of knowledge
rather, it’s a measure of how well something is known
in the case of climate change, scientists have found a range of possible future changes in temperature, precipitation and other important variables — which will depend largely on how quickly we reduce emissions
but uncertainty does not undermine their confidence that climate change is real and that people are causing it

do we really only have 150 years of climate data?
how is that enough to tell us about centuries of change?
earth’s climate is inherently variable
some years are hot and others are cold, some decades bring more hurricanes than others, some ancient droughts spanned the better part of centuries
glacial cycles operate over many millenniums
so how can scientists look at data collected over a relatively short period of time and conclude that humans are warming the planet?
the answer is that the instrumental temperature data that we have tells us a lot, but it’s not all we have to go on
how to protect your health from wildfire smoke card 1 of 6 do masks work?
the best thing to do to prevent breathing in pollutants is to stay indoors
if you have to go outside, put on a mask
but a surgical mask, scarf or bandanna won’t do much to protect you from pollutants
instead, use a n95 face mask or respirator mask
cover both your nose and mouth
how can i keep indoor air clean?
by some estimates, a good air filtration system can cut smoke pollution indoors by about 50 to 80%
if you have central air or an air-conditioning unit, close your windows and switch your system’s filtration settings to recirculate
portable air purifiers with hepa filters can work well in smaller spaces
portable fans and ceiling fans can also help
who is most at risk?
all children and adults with respiratory or cardiovascular conditions are among the most vulnerable to toxins in smoke
older adults and pregnant women are also at higher risk of serious health effects
these people should seek medical assistance if experiencing discomfort or heightened symptoms
what should i do if i have a headache?
breathing in wildfire smoke can cause headaches
to ward that off, restrict the amount of time you spend outdoors, and try to optimize the quality of your indoor air
the most effective treatment for headaches can vary from person to person, but over-the-counter medications like tylenol or advil can help
staying hydrated is also critical
can i go for a run?
you probably shouldn’t, especially if you suffer from chronic respiratory conditions like asthma
during exercise, we largely breathe through our mouths, which — unlike noses — don’t have a natural filtration system for pollutants
exercising in a highly polluted environment has been linked to cardiovascular health risks
smoky conditions can also hinder visibility
how can i monitor the quality of the air?
several apps, including airnow mobile app, can help you track air quality levels
home air quality monitors are limited in their abilities and reliability; keep that in mind if you choose to use one
historical records stretch back to the 1880s (and often before), when people began to regularly measure temperatures at weather stations and on ships as they traversed the world’s oceans

source: nasa goddard institute for space studiesby veronica penney some have questioned whether these records could be skewed, for instance, by the fact that a disproportionate number of weather stations are near cities, which tend to be hotter than surrounding areas as a result of the so-called urban heat island effect
however, researchers regularly correct for these potential biases when reconstructing global temperatures
in addition, warming is corroborated by independent data like satellite observations, which cover the whole planet, and other ways of measuring temperature changes
much has also been made of the small dips and pauses that punctuate the rising temperature trend of the last 150 years
but these are just the result of natural climate variability or other human activities that temporarily counteract greenhouse warming
for instance, in the mid-1900s, internal climate dynamics and light-blocking pollution from coal-fired power plants halted global warming for a few decades
(eventually, rising greenhouse gases and pollution-control laws caused the planet to start heating up again.)
likewise, the so-called warming hiatus of the 2000s was partly a result of natural climate variability that allowed more heat to enter the ocean rather than warm the atmosphere
the years since have been the hottest on record

still, could the entire 20th century just be one big natural climate wiggle?
to address that question, we can look at other kinds of data that give a longer perspective
researchers have used geologic records like tree rings, ice cores, corals and sediments that preserve information about prehistoric climates to extend the climate record
the resulting picture of global temperature change is basically flat for centuries, then turns sharply upward over the last 150 years
it has been a target of climate denialists for decades
however, study after study has confirmed the results, which show that the planet hasn’t been this hot in at least 1,000 years, and probably longer

how do we know climate change is caused by humans?
scientists have studied past climate changes to understand the factors that can cause the planet to warm or cool
the big ones are changes in solar energy, ocean circulation, volcanic activity and the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
and they have each played a role at times
for example, 300 years ago, a combination of reduced solar output and increased volcanic activity cooled parts of the planet enough that londoners regularly ice skated on the thames
about 12,000 years ago, major changes in atlantic circulation plunged the northern hemisphere into a frigid state
and 56 million years ago, a giant burst of greenhouse gases, from volcanic activity or vast deposits of methane (or both), abruptly warmed the planet by at least 9 degrees fahrenheit, scrambling the climate, choking the oceans and triggering mass extinctions
advertisement
skip advertisement
in trying to determine the cause of current climate changes, scientists have looked at all of these factors
the first three have varied a bit over the last few centuries and they have quite likely had modest effects on climate, particularly before 1950 
but they cannot account for the planet’s rapidly rising temperature, especially in the second half of the 20th century, when solar output actually declined and volcanic eruptions exerted a cooling effect
that warming is best explained by rising greenhouse gas concentrations
greenhouse gases have a powerful effect on climate (see the next question for why)
and since the industrial revolution, humans have been adding more of them to the atmosphere, primarily by extracting and burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas, which releases carbon dioxide
bubbles of ancient air trapped in ice show that, before about 1750, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was roughly 280 parts per million
it began to rise slowly and crossed the 300 p.p.m
threshold around 1900 
co2 levels then accelerated as cars and electricity became big parts of modern life, recently topping 420 p.p.m
the concentration of methane, the second most important greenhouse gas, has more than doubled
we’re now emitting carbon much faster than it was released 56 million years ago

in fact, climate models suggest that greenhouse warming can explain virtually all of the temperature change since 1950 
according to the most recent report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change, which assesses published scientific literature, natural drivers and internal climate variability can only explain a small fraction of late-20th century warming

another study put it this way: the odds of current warming occurring without anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are less than 1 in 100,000. but greenhouse gases aren’t the only climate-altering compounds people put into the air
burning fossil fuels also produces particulate pollution that reflects sunlight and cools the planet
scientists estimate that this pollution has masked up to half of the greenhouse warming we would have otherwise experienced

since greenhouse gases occur naturally, how do we know they’re causing earth’s temperature to rise?
greenhouse gases like water vapor and carbon dioxide serve an important role in the climate
without them, earth would be far too cold to maintain liquid water and humans would not exist!
advertisement
skip advertisement
here’s how it works: the planet’s temperature is basically a function of the energy the earth absorbs from the sun (which heats it up) and the energy earth emits to space as infrared radiation (which cools it down)
because of their molecular structure, greenhouse gases temporarily absorb some of that outgoing infrared radiation and then re-emit it in all directions, sending some of that energy back toward the surface and heating the planet
scientists have understood this process since the 1850s
greenhouse gas concentrations have varied naturally in the past
over millions of years, atmospheric co2 levels have changed depending on how much of the gas volcanoes belched into the air and how much got removed through geologic processes
on time scales of hundreds to thousands of years, concentrations have changed as carbon has cycled between the ocean, soil and air
today, however, we are the ones causing co2 levels to increase at an unprecedented pace by taking ancient carbon from geologic deposits of fossil fuels and putting it into the atmosphere when we burn them
since 1750, carbon dioxide concentrations have increased by almost 50 percent
methane and nitrous oxide, other important anthropogenic greenhouse gases that are released mainly by agricultural activities, have also spiked over the last 250 years
we know based on the physics described above that this should cause the climate to warm
we also see certain telltale “fingerprints” of greenhouse warming
for example, nights are warming even faster than days because greenhouse gases don’t go away when the sun sets
and upper layers of the atmosphere have actually cooled, because more energy is being trapped by greenhouse gases in the lower atmosphere
we also know that we are the cause of rising greenhouse gas concentrations — and not just because we can measure the co2 coming out of tailpipes and smokestacks
we can see it in the chemical signature of the carbon in co2
advertisement

carbon comes in three different masses: 12, 13 and 14. things made of organic matter (including fossil fuels) tend to have relatively less carbon-13
volcanoes tend to produce co2 with relatively more carbon-13
and over the last century, the carbon in atmospheric co2 has gotten lighter, pointing to an organic source
we can tell it’s old organic matter by looking for carbon-14, which is radioactive and decays over time
fossil fuels are too ancient to have any carbon-14 left in them, so if they were behind rising co2 levels, you would expect the amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere to drop, which is exactly what the data show
it’s important to note that water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere
however, it does not cause warming; instead it responds to it
that’s because warmer air holds more moisture, which creates a snowball effect in which human-caused warming allows the atmosphere to hold more water vapor and further amplifies climate change
this so-called feedback cycle has doubled the warming caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions

why should we be worried that the planet has warmed 2°f since the 1800s?
a common source of confusion when it comes to climate change is the difference between weather and climate
weather is the constantly changing set of meteorological conditions that we experience when we step outside, whereas climate is the long-term average of those conditions, usually calculated over a 30-year period
or, as some say: weather is your mood and climate is your personality
so while 2 degrees fahrenheit doesn’t represent a big change in the weather, it’s a huge change in climate
as we’ve already seen, it’s enough to melt ice and raise sea levels, to shift rainfall patterns around the world and to reorganize ecosystems, sending animals scurrying toward cooler habitats and killing trees by the millions
it’s also important to remember that two degrees represents the global average, and many parts of the world have already warmed by more than that
for example, land areas have warmed about twice as much as the sea surface
and the arctic has warmed by about 5 degrees
that’s because the loss of snow and ice at high latitudes allows the ground to absorb more energy, causing additional heating on top of greenhouse warming
relatively small long-term changes in climate averages also shift extremes in significant ways
for instance, heat waves have always happened, but they have shattered records in recent years
in june of 2020, a town in siberia registered temperatures of 100 degrees
and in australia, meteorologists have added a new color to their weather maps to show areas where temperatures exceed 125 degrees
rising sea levels have also increased the risk of flooding because of storm surges and high tides
these are the foreshocks of climate change
and we are in for more changes in the future — up to 9 degrees fahrenheit of average global warming by the end of the century, in the worst-case scenario
for reference, the difference in global average temperatures between now and the peak of the last ice age, when ice sheets covered large parts of north america and europe, is about 11 degrees fahrenheit

under the paris climate agreement, which president biden recently rejoined, countries have agreed to try to limit total warming to between 1.5 and 2 degrees celsius, or 2.7 and 3.6 degrees fahrenheit, since preindustrial times
and even this narrow range has huge implications
according to scientific studies, the difference between 2.7 and 3.6 degrees fahrenheit will very likely mean the difference between coral reefs hanging on or going extinct, and between summer sea ice persisting in the arctic or disappearing completely
it will also determine how many millions of people suffer from water scarcity and crop failures, and how many are driven from their homes by rising seas
in other words, one degree fahrenheit makes a world of difference

is climate change a part of the planet’s natural warming and cooling cycles?
earth’s climate has always changed
hundreds of millions of years ago, the entire planet froze
fifty million years ago, alligators lived in what we now call the arctic
and for the last 2.6 million years, the planet has cycled between ice ages when the planet was up to 11 degrees cooler and ice sheets covered much of north america and europe, and milder interglacial periods like the one we’re in now
climate denialists often point to these natural climate changes as a way to cast doubt on the idea that humans are causing climate to change today
however, that argument rests on a logical fallacy
it’s like “seeing a murdered body and concluding that people have died of natural causes in the past, so the murder victim must also have died of natural causes,” a team of social scientists wrote in the debunking handbook, which explains the misinformation strategies behind many climate myths

indeed, we know that different mechanisms caused the climate to change in the past
glacial cycles, for example, were triggered by periodic variations in earth’s orbit, which take place over tens of thousands of years and change how solar energy gets distributed around the globe and across the seasons
these orbital variations don’t affect the planet’s temperature much on their own
but they set off a cascade of other changes in the climate system; for instance, growing or melting vast northern hemisphere ice sheets and altering ocean circulation
these changes, in turn, affect climate by altering the amount of snow and ice, which reflect sunlight, and by changing greenhouse gas concentrations
this is actually part of how we know that greenhouse gases have the ability to significantly affect earth’s temperature
for at least the last 800,000 years, atmospheric co2 concentrations oscillated between about 180 parts per million during ice ages and about 280 p.p.m
during warmer periods, as carbon moved between oceans, forests, soils and the atmosphere
these changes occurred in lock step with global temperatures, and are a major reason the entire planet warmed and cooled during glacial cycles, not just the frozen poles
today, however, co2 levels have soared to 420 p.p.m
— the highest they’ve been in at least three million years
the concentration of co2 is also increasing about 100 times faster than it did at the end of the last ice age
this suggests something else is going on, and we know what it is: since the industrial revolution, humans have been burning fossil fuels and releasing greenhouse gases that are heating the planet now (see question 5 for more details on how we know this, and questions 4 and 8 for how we know that other natural forces aren’t to blame)
over the next century or two, societies and ecosystems will experience the consequences of this climate change
but our emissions will have even more lasting geologic impacts: according to some studies, greenhouse gas levels may have already warmed the planet enough to delay the onset of the next glacial cycle for at least an additional 50,000 years

how do we know global warming is not because of the sun or volcanoes?
the sun is the ultimate source of energy in earth’s climate system, so it’s a natural candidate for causing climate change
and solar activity has certainly changed over time
we know from satellite measurements and other astronomical observations that the sun’s output changes on 11-year cycles
geologic records and sunspot numbers, which astronomers have tracked for centuries, also show long-term variations in the sun’s activity, including some exceptionally quiet periods in the late 1600s and early 1800s
more on wildfires and wildfire smoke undoing progress: two new reports have found that smoke from increasingly frequent and increasingly large wildfires has started to undo decades of hard-won gains in air quality around the world
fighting the wildfires: canada’s record-shattering wildfire season has made it clear that traditional firefighting methods are no longer enough, experts in wildfires and forests say
here are the fundamental changes in strategy they suggest
a devastating toll: the blazes in canada have led tens of thousands of indigenous people to flee their homes and ravaged forests they rely on for sustenance
we know that, from 1900 until the 1950s, solar irradiance increased
and studies suggest that this had a modest effect on early 20th century climate, explaining up to 10 percent of the warming that’s occurred since the late 1800s
however, in the second half of the century, when the most warming occurred, solar activity actually declined
this disparity is one of the main reasons we know that the sun is not the driving force behind climate change
another reason we know that solar activity hasn’t caused recent warming is that, if it had, all the layers of the atmosphere should be heating up
instead, data show that the upper atmosphere has actually cooled in recent decades — a hallmark of greenhouse warming
so how about volcanoes?
eruptions cool the planet by injecting ash and aerosol particles into the atmosphere that reflect sunlight
we’ve observed this effect in the years following large eruptions
there are also some notable historical examples, like when iceland’s laki volcano erupted in 1783, causing widespread crop failures in europe and beyond, and the “year without a summer,” which followed the 1815 eruption of mount tambora in indonesia
since volcanoes mainly act as climate coolers, they can’t really explain recent warming
however, scientists say that they may also have contributed slightly to rising temperatures in the early 20th century
that’s because there were several large eruptions in the late 1800s that cooled the planet, followed by a few decades with no major volcanic events when warming caught up
during the second half of the 20th century, though, several big eruptions occurred as the planet was heating up fast
if anything, they temporarily masked some amount of human-caused warming
the second way volcanoes can impact climate is by emitting carbon dioxide
this is important on time scales of millions of years — it’s what keeps the planet habitable (see question 5 for more on the greenhouse effect)
but by comparison to modern anthropogenic emissions, even big eruptions like krakatoa and mount st. helens are just a drop in the bucket
after all, they last only a few hours or days, while we burn fossil fuels 24-7. studies suggest that, today, volcanoes account for 1 to 2 percent of total co2 emissions

how can winters and certain places be getting colder if the planet is warming?
when a big snowstorm hits the united states, climate denialists can try to cite it as proof that climate change isn’t happening
in 2015, senator james inhofe, an oklahoma republican, famously lobbed a snowball in the senate as he denounced climate science
but these events don’t actually disprove climate change
while there have been some memorable storms in recent years, winters are actually warming across the world
in the united states, average temperatures in december, january and february have increased by about 2.5 degrees this century
on the flip side, record cold days are becoming less common than record warm days
in the united states, record highs now outnumber record lows two-to-one
and ever-smaller areas of the country experience extremely cold winter temperatures
(the same trends are happening globally.)
so what’s with the blizzards?
weather always varies, so it’s no surprise that we still have severe winter storms even as average temperatures rise
however, some studies suggest that climate change may be to blame
one possibility is that rapid arctic warming has affected atmospheric circulation, including the fast-flowing, high-altitude air that usually swirls over the north pole (a.k.a
the polar vortex)
some studies suggest that these changes are bringing more frigid temperatures to lower latitudes and causing weather systems to stall, allowing storms to produce more snowfall
this may explain what we’ve experienced in the u.s. over the past few decades, as well as a wintertime cooling trend in siberia, although exactly how the arctic affects global weather remains a topic of ongoing scientific debate
climate change may also explain the apparent paradox behind some of the other places on earth that haven’t warmed much
for instance, a splotch of water in the north atlantic has cooled in recent years, and scientists say they suspect that may be because ocean circulation is slowing as a result of freshwater streaming off a melting greenland
if this circulation grinds almost to a halt, as it’s done in the geologic past, it would alter weather patterns around the world
not all cold weather stems from some counterintuitive consequence of climate change
but it’s a good reminder that earth’s climate system is complex and chaotic, so the effects of human-caused changes will play out differently in different places
that’s why “global warming” is a bit of an oversimplification
instead, some scientists have suggested that the phenomenon of human-caused climate change would more aptly be called “global weirding.”

wildfires and bad weather have always happened
how do we know there’s a connection to climate change?
extreme weather and natural disasters are part of life on earth — just ask the dinosaurs
but there is good evidence that climate change has increased the frequency and severity of certain phenomena like heat waves, droughts and floods
recent research has also allowed scientists to identify the influence of climate change on specific events
let’s start with heat waves
studies show that stretches of abnormally high temperatures now happen about five times more often than they would without climate change, and they last longer, too
climate models project that, by the 2040s, heat waves will be about 12 times more frequent
and that’s concerning since extreme heat often causes increased hospitalizations and deaths, particularly among older people and those with underlying health conditions
in the summer of 2003, for example, a heat wave caused an estimated 70,000 excess deaths across europe
(human-caused warming amplified the death toll.)
climate change has also exacerbated droughts, primarily by increasing evaporation
droughts occur naturally because of random climate variability and factors like whether el niño or la niña conditions prevail in the tropical pacific
but some researchers have found evidence that greenhouse warming has been affecting droughts since even before the dust bowl
and it continues to do so today
according to one analysis, the drought that afflicted the american southwest from 2000 to 2018 was almost 50 percent more severe because of climate change
it was the worst drought the region had experienced in more than 1,000 years
rising temperatures have also increased the intensity of heavy precipitation events and the flooding that often follows
for example, studies have found that, because warmer air holds more moisture, hurricane harvey, which struck houston in 2017, dropped between 15 and 40 percent more rainfall than it would have without climate change
it’s still unclear whether climate change is changing the overall frequency of hurricanes, but it is making them stronger
and warming appears to favor certain kinds of weather patterns, like the “midwest water hose” events that caused devastating flooding across the midwest in 2019 
it’s important to remember that in most natural disasters, there are multiple factors at play
for instance, the 2019 midwest floods occurred after a recent cold snap had frozen the ground solid, preventing the soil from absorbing rainwater and increasing runoff into the missouri and mississippi rivers
these waterways have also been reshaped by levees and other forms of river engineering, some of which failed in the floods
wildfires are another phenomenon with multiple causes
in many places, fire risk has increased because humans have aggressively fought natural fires and prevented indigenous peoples from carrying out traditional burning practices
this has allowed fuel to accumulate that makes current fires worse
however, climate change still plays a major role by heating and drying forests, turning them into tinderboxes
studies show that warming is the driving factor behind the recent increases in wildfires; one analysis found that climate change is responsible for doubling the area burned across the american west between 1984 and 2015 
and researchers say that warming will only make fires bigger and more dangerous in the future

5 things we know about climate change and hurricanes nov. 10, 2020 image
how bad are the effects of climate change going to be?
it depends on how aggressively we act to address climate change
if we continue with business as usual, by the end of the century, it will be too hot to go outside during heat waves in the middle east and south asia
droughts will grip central america, the mediterranean and southern africa
and many island nations and low-lying areas, from texas to bangladesh, will be overtaken by rising seas
conversely, climate change could bring welcome warming and extended growing seasons to the upper midwest, canada, the nordic countries and russia
farther north, however, the loss of snow, ice and permafrost will upend the traditions of indigenous peoples and threaten infrastructure
it’s complicated, but the underlying message is simple: unchecked climate change will likely exacerbate existing inequalities
at a national level, poorer countries will be hit hardest, even though they have historically emitted only a fraction of the greenhouse gases that cause warming
that’s because many less developed countries tend to be in tropical regions where additional warming will make the climate increasingly intolerable for humans and crops
these nations also often have greater vulnerabilities, like large coastal populations and people living in improvised housing that is easily damaged in storms
and they have fewer resources to adapt, which will require expensive measures like redesigning cities, engineering coastlines and changing how people grow food
already, between 1961 and 2000, climate change appears to have harmed the economies of the poorest countries while boosting the fortunes of the wealthiest nations that have done the most to cause the problem, making the global wealth gap 25 percent bigger than it would otherwise have been
similarly, the global climate risk index found that lower income countries — like myanmar, haiti and nepal — rank high on the list of nations most affected by extreme weather between 1999 and 2018 
climate change has also contributed to increased human migration, which is expected to increase significantly
even within wealthy countries, the poor and marginalized will suffer the most
people with more resources have greater buffers, like air-conditioners to keep their houses cool during dangerous heat waves, and the means to pay the resulting energy bills
they also have an easier time evacuating their homes before disasters, and recovering afterward
lower income people have fewer of these advantages, and they are also more likely to live in hotter neighborhoods and work outdoors, where they face the brunt of climate change
these inequalities will play out on an individual, community, and regional level
a 2017 analysis of the u.s. found that, under business as usual, the poorest one-third of counties, which are concentrated in the south, will experience damages totaling as much as 20 percent of gross domestic product, while others, mostly in the northern part of the country, will see modest economic gains
solomon hsiang, an economist at university of california, berkeley, and the lead author of the study, has said that climate change “may result in the largest transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich in the country’s history.”
even the climate “winners” will not be immune from all climate impacts, though
desirable locations will face an influx of migrants
and as the coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated, disasters in one place quickly ripple across our globalized economy
for instance, scientists expect climate change to increase the odds of multiple crop failures occurring at the same time in different places, throwing the world into a food crisis
on top of that, warmer weather is aiding the spread of infectious diseases and the vectors that transmit them, like ticks and mosquitoes
research has also identified troubling correlations between rising temperatures and increased interpersonal violence, and climate change is widely recognized as a “threat multiplier” that increases the odds of larger conflicts within and between countries
in other words, climate change will bring many changes that no amount of money can stop
what could help is taking action to limit warming
back to top
here's what extreme heat looks like: profoundly unequal
global warming in south asia: 800 million at risk
as climate changes, southern states will suffer more than others
summer in the city is hot, but some neighborhoods suffer more image
what will it cost to do something about climate change, versus doing nothing?
one of the most common arguments against taking aggressive action to combat climate change is that doing so will kill jobs and cripple the economy
but this implies that there’s an alternative in which we pay nothing for climate change
and unfortunately, there isn’t
in reality, not tackling climate change will cost a lot, and cause enormous human suffering and ecological damage, while transitioning to a greener economy would benefit many people and ecosystems around the world
let’s start with how much it will cost to address climate change
to keep warming well below 2 degrees celsius, the goal of the paris climate agreement, society will have to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of this century
that will require significant investments in things like renewable energy, electric cars and charging infrastructure, not to mention efforts to adapt to hotter temperatures, rising sea-levels and other unavoidable effects of current climate changes
and we’ll have to make changes fast
estimates of the cost vary widely
one recent study found that keeping warming to 2 degrees celsius would require a total investment of between $4 trillion and $60 trillion, with a median estimate of $16 trillion, while keeping warming to 1.5 degrees celsius could cost between $10 trillion and $100 trillion, with a median estimate of $30 trillion
(for reference, the entire world economy was about $88 trillion in 2019.)
other studies have found that reaching net zero will require annual investments ranging from less than 1.5 percent of global gross domestic product to as much as 4 percent
that’s a lot, but within the range of historical energy investments in countries like the u.s. now, let’s consider the costs of unchecked climate change, which will fall hardest on the most vulnerable
these include damage to property and infrastructure from sea-level rise and extreme weather, death and sickness linked to natural disasters, pollution and infectious disease, reduced agricultural yields and lost labor productivity because of rising temperatures, decreased water availability and increased energy costs, and species extinction and habitat destruction
dr. hsiang, the u.c
berkeley economist, describes it as “death by a thousand cuts.”
as a result, climate damages are hard to quantify
moody’s analytics estimates that even 2 degrees celsius of warming will cost the world $69 trillion by 2100, and economists expect the toll to keep rising with the temperature
in a recent survey, economists estimated the cost would equal 5 percent of global g.d.p
at 3 degrees celsius of warming (our trajectory under current policies) and 10 percent for 5 degrees celsius
other research indicates that, if current warming trends continue, global g.d.p
per capita will decrease between 7 percent and 23 percent by the end of the century — an economic blow equivalent to multiple coronavirus pandemics every year
and some fear these are vast underestimates
already, studies suggest that climate change has slashed incomes in the poorest countries by as much as 30 percent and reduced global agricultural productivity by 21 percent since 1961 
extreme weather events have also racked up a large bill
in 2020, in the united states alone, climate-related disasters like hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires caused nearly $100 billion in damages to businesses, property and infrastructure, compared to an average of $18 billion per year in the 1980s
given the steep price of inaction, many economists say that addressing climate change is a better deal
it’s like that old saying: an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
in this case, limiting warming will greatly reduce future damage and inequality caused by climate change
it will also produce so-called co-benefits, like saving one million lives every year by reducing air pollution, and millions more from eating healthier, climate-friendly diets
some studies even find that meeting the paris agreement goals could create jobs and increase global g.d.p
and, of course, reining in climate change will spare many species and ecosystems upon which humans depend — and which many people believe to have their own innate value
the challenge is that we need to reduce emissions now to avoid damages later, which requires big investments over the next few decades
and the longer we delay, the more we will pay to meet the paris goals
one recent analysis found that reaching net-zero by 2050 would cost the u.s. almost twice as much if we waited until 2030 instead of acting now
but even if we miss the paris target, the economics still make a strong case for climate action, because every additional degree of warming will cost us more — in dollars, and in lives
climate change
climate change is the defining issue of our time and we are at a defining moment
from shifting weather patterns that threaten food production, to rising sea levels that increase the risk of catastrophic flooding, the impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale
without drastic action today, adapting to these impacts in the future will be more difficult and costly
the human fingerprint on greenhouse gases greenhouse gases occur naturally and are essential to the survival of humans and millions of other living things, by keeping some of the sun’s warmth from reflecting back into space and making earth livable
but after more than a century and a half of industrialization, deforestation, and large scale agriculture, quantities of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have risen to record levels not seen in three million years
as populations, economies and standards of living grow, so does the cumulative level of greenhouse gas (ghgs) emissions
there are some basic well-established scientific links:
the concentration of ghgs in the earth’s atmosphere is directly linked to the average global temperature on earth; the concentration has been rising steadily, and mean global temperatures along with it, since the time of the industrial revolution; the most abundant ghg, accounting for about two-thirds of ghgs, carbon dioxide (co2), is largely the product of burning fossil fuels
the un intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) was set up by the world meteorological organization (wmo) and united nations environment to provide an objective source of scientific information
sixth assessment report the ipcc’s sixth assessment report, to be released in march 2023, provides an overview of the state of knowledge on the science of climate change, emphasizing new results since the publication of the fifth assessment report in 2014 
it is based on the reports of the three working groups of the ipcc – on the physical science; impacts, adaptation and vulnerability; and mitigation – as well as on the three special reports on global warming of 1.5°c, on climate change and land, and on the ocean and the cryosphere in a changing climate
what we know based on the ipcc reports:
it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land
widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred
the scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole – and the present state of many aspects of the climate system – are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years
human-induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe
evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has strengthened since the fifth assessment report
approximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate change
vulnerability of ecosystems and people to climate change differs substantially among and within regions
if global warming transiently exceeds 1.5°c in the coming decades or later, then many human and natural systems will face additional severe risks, compared to remaining below 1.5°c
reducing ghg emissions across the full energy sector requires major transitions, including a substantial reduction in overall fossil fuel use, the deployment of low-emission energy sources, switching to alternative energy carriers, and energy efficiency and conservation
global warming of 1.5°c in october 2018 the ipcc issued a special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°c, finding that limiting global warming to 1.5°c would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society
with clear benefits to people and natural ecosystems, the report found that limiting global warming to 1.5°c compared to 2°c could go hand in hand with ensuring a more sustainable and equitable society
while previous estimates focused on estimating the damage if average temperatures were to rise by 2°c, this report shows that many of the adverse impacts of climate change will come at the 1.5°c mark
the report also highlights a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to 1.5ºc compared to 2ºc, or more
for instance, by 2100, global sea level rise would be 10 cm lower with global warming of 1.5°c compared with 2°c
the likelihood of an arctic ocean free of sea ice in summer would be once per century with global warming of 1.5°c, compared with at least once per decade with 2°c
coral reefs would decline by 70-90 percent with global warming of 1.5°c, whereas virtually all (> 99 percent) would be lost with 2ºc
the report finds that limiting global warming to 1.5°c would require “rapid and far-reaching” transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport, and cities
global net human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide (co2) would need to fall by about 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching ‘net zero’ around 2050 
this means that any remaining emissions would need to be balanced by removing co2 from the air
united nations legal instruments united nations framework convention on climate change the un family is at the forefront of the effort to save our planet
in 1992, its “earth summit” produced the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) as a first step in addressing the climate change problem
today, it has near-universal membership
the 197 countries that have ratified the convention are parties to the convention
the ultimate aim of the convention is to prevent “dangerous” human interference with the climate system
kyoto protocol by 1995, countries launched negotiations to strengthen the global response to climate change, and, two years later, adopted the kyoto protocol
the kyoto protocol legally binds developed country parties to emission reduction targets
the protocol’s first commitment period started in 2008 and ended in 2012 
the second commitment period began on 1 january 2013 and ended in 2020 
there are now 198 parties to the convention and 192 parties to the kyoto protocol
paris agreement
at the 21st conference of the parties in paris in 2015, parties to the unfccc reached a landmark agreement to combat climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low carbon future
the paris agreement builds upon the convention and – for the first time – brings all nations into a common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects, with enhanced support to assist developing countries to do so
as such, it charts a new course in the global climate effort
the paris agreement’s central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees celsius
on earth day, 22 april 2016, 175 world leaders signed the paris agreement at united nations headquarters in new york
this was by far the largest number of countries ever to sign an international agreement on a single day
there are now 194 countries that have ratified the paris agreement
nobel peace prize in 2007, the nobel peace prize was awarded jointly to former united states vice-president al gore and the ipcc "for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change."
climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns
such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun’s activity or large volcanic eruptions
but since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas
burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures
the main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane
these come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example
clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide
agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions
energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases
the earth is feeling the heat
humans are responsible for global warming climate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years
human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years
the average temperature of the earth’s surface is now about 1.1°c warmer than it was in the late 1800s (before the industrial revolution) and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years
the last decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850 
many people think climate change mainly means warmer temperatures
but temperature rise is only the beginning of the story
because the earth is a system, where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others
the consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity
the earth is asking for help
people are experiencing climate change in diverse ways climate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work
some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries
conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where whole communities have had to relocate, and protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine
in the future, the number of people displaced by weather-related events is expected to rise
every increase in global warming matters in a series of un reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5°c would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a livable climate
yet policies currently in place point to a 2.8°c temperature rise by the end of the century
the emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others.the seven biggest emitters alone (china, the united states of america, india, the european union, indonesia, the russian federation, and brazil) accounted for about half of all global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 
everyone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first
photocomposition: an image of the world globe looking worried to a thermometer with raising temperatures 
we face a huge challenge but already know many solutions many climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment
we also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the sustainable development goals, the un framework convention on climate change and the paris agreement
three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments
switching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change
but we have to act now
while a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5°c
achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: over two-thirds of today’s proven reserves of fossil fuels need to be kept in the ground by 2050 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change
growing coalition 
adapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure and natural ecosystems
it covers current impacts and those likely in the future
adaptation will be required everywhere, but must be prioritized now for the most vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards
the rate of return can be high
early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost
we can pay the bill now, or pay dearly in the future climate action requires significant financial investments by governments and businesses
but climate inaction is vastly more expensive
one critical step is for industrialized countries to fulfil their commitment to provide $100 billion a year to developing countries so they can adapt and move towards greener economies

this article is about contemporary climate change
for historical climate trends, see climate variability and change
the global map shows sea temperature rises of 0.5 to 1 degree celsius; land temperature rises of 1 to 2 degree celsius; and arctic temperature rises of up to 4 degrees celsius
average surface air temperatures 2011–21 compared to 1956–76 the graph from 1880 to 2020 shows natural drivers exhibiting fluctuations of about 0.3 degrees celsius
human drivers steadily increase by 0.3 degrees over 100 years to 1980, then steeply by 0.8 degrees more over the past 40 years
change in average surface air temperature since the industrial revolution, plus drivers for that change
human activity has caused increased temperatures, with natural forces adding some variability
in common usage, climate change describes global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its effects on earth's climate system
climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to earth's climate
the current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels
fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices add to greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane
greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the earth radiates after it warms from sunlight
larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming
climate change is causing a range of increasing impacts on the environment
deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common
amplified warming in the arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss
higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes
rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct
even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries
these include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise
climate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss
human migration and conflict can also be a result
the world health organization (who) calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century
societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming
adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached
poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change
bobcat fire in monrovia, ca, september 10, 2020 bleached colony of acropora coral a dry lakebed in california, which is experiencing its worst megadrought in 1,200 years
some effects of climate change: wildfire intensified by heat and drought, bleaching of coral caused by marine heatwaves, and worsening droughts compromising water supplies
many climate change impacts are already felt at the current 1.2 °c (2.2 °f) level of warming
additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as the melting of the greenland ice sheet
under the 2015 paris agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming "well under 2 °c"
however, with pledges made under the agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 °c (4.9 °f) by the end of the century
limiting warming to 1.5 °c will require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 
reducing emissions requires reducing energy use and generating electricity from low-carbon sources rather than burning fossil fuels
this change includes phasing out coal and natural gas fired power plants while vastly increasing electricity generated from wind, solar, and nuclear power
this electricity will need to replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and operating industrial facilities
carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere, for instance by increasing forest cover and farming with methods that capture carbon in soil
terminology before the 1980s, when it was unclear whether the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases was stronger than the cooling effect of airborne particulates in air pollution, scientists used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to human impacts on the climate
in the 1980s, the terms global warming and climate change became more common
though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably, scientifically, global warming refers only to increased surface warming, while climate change describes the totality of changes to earth's climate system
global warming—used as early as 1975—became the more popular term after nasa climate scientist james hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in the u.s. senate
since the 2000s, climate change has increased in usage
climate change can also refer more broadly to both human-caused changes or natural changes throughout earth's history
various scientists, politicians and media now use the terms climate crisis or climate emergency to talk about climate change, and global heating instead of global warming
observed temperature rise main articles: temperature record of the last 2,000 years and instrumental temperature record
in recent decades, new high temperature records have substantially outpaced new low temperature records on a growing portion of earth's surface
there has been an increase in ocean heat content during recent decades as the oceans absorb over 90% of the heat from global warming
multiple independent instrumental datasets show that the climate system is warming
a so-called "global warming hiatus" from 1998 to 2013 when warming was relatively slow was likely caused by negative phases of the pacific decadal oscillation (pdo) and atlantic multidecadal oscillation (amo)
the 2013-2022 decade warmed to an average 1.15 °c [1.00–1.25 °c] compared to the pre-industrial baseline (1850–1900)
surface temperatures are rising by about 0.2 °c per decade, with 2020 reaching a temperature of 1.2 °c above the pre-industrial era
since 1950, the number of cold days and nights has decreased, and the number of warm days and nights has increased
evidence of warming from air temperature measurements is reinforced by a wide range of other observations
for example, changes to the natural water cycle have been predicted and observed, such as an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, melting of snow and land ice, and increased atmospheric humidity
flora and fauna are also behaving in a manner consistent with warming; for instance, plants are flowering earlier in spring
another key indicator is the cooling of the upper atmosphere, which demonstrates that greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the earth's surface and preventing it from radiating into space
different regions of the world warm at different rates
the pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet
since the pre-industrial period, the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global-average surface temperature
this is because of the larger heat capacity of oceans, and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation
the thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970, and over 90% of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean
the rest has heated the atmosphere, melted ice, and warmed the continents
the northern hemisphere and the north pole have warmed much faster than the south pole and southern hemisphere
the northern hemisphere not only has much more land, but also more seasonal snow cover and sea ice
as these surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted, they start absorbing more heat
local black carbon deposits on snow and ice also contribute to arctic warming
arctic temperatures are increasing at over twice the rate of the rest of the world
melting of glaciers and ice sheets in the arctic disrupts ocean circulation, including a weakened gulf stream, further changing the climate
temperature records prior to global warming main articles: climate variability and change and paleoclimatology
global surface temperature reconstruction over the last 2000 years using proxy data from tree rings, corals, and ice cores in blue
directly observed data is in red
human beings evolved over the last few million years in a climate that cycled through ice ages, with global average temperature ranging between current levels and 5–6 °c colder than today
the temperature record prior to human evolution includes hotter temperatures and occasional abrupt changes, such as the paleocene–eocene thermal maximum 55.5 million years ago
historical patterns of warming and cooling, like the medieval warm period and the little ice age, did not occur at the same time across different regions
temperatures may have reached as high as those of the late 20th century in a limited set of regions
there was little net warming between the 18th century and the mid-19th century
climate information for that period comes from climate proxies, such as trees and ice cores
thermometer records began to provide global coverage around 1850 
attribution of recent temperature rise main article: attribution of recent climate change
drivers of climate change from 1850–1900 to 2010–2019 
there was no significant contribution from internal variability or solar and volcanic drivers
the climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years (such as the el niño–southern oscillation (enso)), decades or even centuries
other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy that is "external" to the climate system, but not always external to the earth
examples of external forcings include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in the earth's orbit around the sun
to determine the human contribution to climate change, known internal climate variability and natural external forcings are ruled out
unique "fingerprints" for all potential causes are determined and compared with observed patterns of climate change
for example, solar forcing—whose fingerprint involves warming the entire atmosphere—is ruled out because only the lower atmosphere has warmed
attribution of recent climate change shows that the climate's main driver is elevated greenhouse gases, with aerosols having a dampening effect
greenhouse gases main articles: greenhouse gas, greenhouse gas emissions, greenhouse effect, and carbon dioxide in earth's atmosphere
co2 concentrations over the last 800,000 years as measured from ice cores (blue/green) and directly (black) greenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the earth's surface
the earth radiates it as heat, and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it
this absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space, trapping heat near the earth's surface and warming it over time
before the industrial revolution, naturally-occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33 °c warmer than it would have been in their absence
while water vapour (≈50%) and clouds (≈25%) are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect, they increase as a function of temperature and are therefore feedbacks
on the other hand, concentrations of gases such as co2 (≈20%), tropospheric ozone, cfcs and nitrous oxide are not temperature-dependent, and are therefore external forcings
human activity since the industrial revolution, mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, resulting in a radiative imbalance
in 2019, the concentrations of co2 and methane had increased by about 48% and 160%, respectively, since 1750 
these co2 levels are higher than they have been at any time during the last 2 million years
concentrations of methane are far higher than they were over the last 800,000 years
the global carbon project shows how additions to co2 since 1880 have been caused by different sources ramping up one after another
global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were equivalent to 59 billion tonnes of co2
of these emissions, 75% was co2, 18% was methane, 4% was nitrous oxide, and 2% was fluorinated gases
co2 emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy for transport, manufacturing, heating, and electricity
additional co2 emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes, which include the co2 released by the chemical reactions for making cement, steel, aluminum, and fertiliser
methane emissions come from livestock, manure, rice cultivation, landfills, wastewater, and coal mining, as well as oil and gas extraction
nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of fertiliser
despite the contribution of deforestation to greenhouse gas emissions, the earth's land surface, particularly its forests, remain a significant carbon sink for co2
land-surface sink processes, such as carbon fixation in the soil and photosynthesis, remove about 29% of annual global co2 emissions
the ocean also serves as a significant carbon sink via a two-step process
first, co2 dissolves in the surface water
afterwards, the ocean's overturning circulation distributes it deep into the ocean's interior, where it accumulates over time as part of the carbon cycle
over the last two decades, the world's oceans have absorbed 20 to 30% of emitted co2
aerosols and clouds air pollution, in the form of aerosols, affects the climate on a large scale
aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation
from 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the earth's surface was observed
this phenomenon is popularly known as global dimming, and is attributed to aerosols produced by dust, pollution and combustion of biofuels and fossil fuels
globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990 due to pollution controls, meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much
aerosols also have indirect effects on the earth's radiation budget
sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets
these clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets
they also reduce the growth of raindrops, which makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight
indirect effects of aerosols are the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing
while aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight, black carbon in soot that falls on snow or ice can contribute to global warming
not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight, it also increases melting and sea-level rise
limiting new black carbon deposits in the arctic could reduce global warming by 0.2 °c by 2050 
land surface changes
the rate of global tree cover loss has approximately doubled since 2001, to an annual loss approaching an area the size of italy
humans change the earth's surface mainly to create more agricultural land
today, agriculture takes up 34% of earth's land area, while 26% is forests, and 30% is uninhabitable (glaciers, deserts, etc.)
the amount of forested land continues to decrease, which is the main land use change that causes global warming
deforestation releases co2 contained in trees when they are destroyed, plus it prevents those trees from absorbing more co2
the main causes of deforestation are: permanent land-use change from forest to agricultural land producing products such as beef and palm oil (27%), logging to produce forestry/forest products (26%), short term shifting cultivation (24%), and wildfires (23%)
the type of vegetation in a region affects the local temperature
it impacts how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space (albedo), and how much heat is lost by evaporation
for instance, the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight
deforestation can also affect temperatures by modifying the release of chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns
in tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming, while at latitudes closer to the poles a gain of albedo (as forest is replaced by snow cover) leads to a cooling effect
globally, these effects are estimated to have led to a slight cooling, dominated by an increase in surface albedo
according to fao, forest degradation aggravates the impacts of climate change as it reduces the carbon sequestration abilities of forests
indeed, among their many benefits, forests also have the potential to reduce the impact of high temperatures
solar and volcanic activity further information: solar activity and climate as the sun is the earth's primary energy source, changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system
solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites, and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s onwards
since 1880, there has been no upward trend in the amount of the sun's energy reaching the earth
explosive volcanic eruptions represent the largest natural forcing over the industrial era
when the eruption is sufficiently strong (with sulfur dioxide reaching the stratosphere), sunlight can be partially blocked for a couple of years
the temperature signal lasts about twice as long
in the industrial era, volcanic activity has had negligible impacts on global temperature trends
present-day volcanic co2 emissions are equivalent to less than 1% of current anthropogenic co2 emissions
physical climate models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when taking into account only variations in solar output and volcanic activity
further evidence for greenhouse gases causing global warming comes from measurements that show a warming of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere), coupled with a cooling of the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere)
if solar variations were responsible for the observed warming, the troposphere and stratosphere would both warm
climate change feedback main articles: climate change feedback and climate sensitivity
sea ice reflects 50% to 70% of incoming sunlight, while the ocean, being darker, reflects only 6%
as an area of sea ice melts and exposes more ocean, more heat is absorbed by the ocean, raising temperatures that melt still more ice
this is a positive feedback process
the response of the climate system to an initial forcing is modified by feedbacks: increased by "self-reinforcing" or "positive" feedbacks and reduced by "balancing" or "negative" feedbacks
the main reinforcing feedbacks are the water-vapour feedback, the ice–albedo feedback, and the net effect of clouds
the primary balancing mechanism is radiative cooling, as earth's surface gives off more heat to space in response to rising temperature
in addition to temperature feedbacks, there are feedbacks in the carbon cycle, such as the fertilizing effect of co2 on plant growth
uncertainty over feedbacks is the major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given amount of emissions
as air warms, it can hold more moisture
water vapour, as a potent greenhouse gas, holds heat in the atmosphere
if cloud cover increases, more sunlight will be reflected back into space, cooling the planet
if clouds become higher and thinner, they act as an insulator, reflecting heat from below back downwards and warming the planet
the effect of clouds is the largest source of feedback uncertainty
another major feedback is the reduction of snow cover and sea ice in the arctic, which reduces the reflectivity of the earth's surface
more of the sun's energy is now absorbed in these regions, contributing to amplification of arctic temperature changes
arctic amplification is also melting permafrost, which releases methane and co2 into the atmosphere
climate change can also cause methane releases from wetlands, marine systems, and freshwater systems
overall, climate feedbacks are expected to become increasingly positive
around half of human-caused co2 emissions have been absorbed by land plants and by the oceans
climate change increases droughts and heat waves that inhibit plant growth, which makes it uncertain whether this carbon sink will continue to grow
soils contain large quantities of carbon and may release some when they heat up
as more co2 and heat are absorbed by the ocean, it acidifies, its circulation changes and phytoplankton takes up less carbon, decreasing the rate at which the ocean absorbs atmospheric carbon
overall, at higher co2 concentrations the earth will absorb a reduced fraction of our emissions
modelling further information: carbon budget, climate model, climate change scenario, and earth's energy budget
projected global surface temperature changes relative to 1850–1900, based on cmip6 multi-model mean changes a climate model is a representation of the physical, chemical and biological processes that affect the climate system
models also include natural processes like changes in the earth's orbit, historical changes in the sun's activity, and volcanic forcing
models are used to estimate the degree of warming future emissions will cause when accounting for the strength of climate feedbacks, or reproduce and predict the circulation of the oceans, the annual cycle of the seasons, and the flows of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere
the physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates
past models have underestimated the rate of arctic shrinkage and underestimated the rate of precipitation increase
sea level rise since 1990 was underestimated in older models, but more recent models agree well with observations
the 2017 united states-published national climate assessment notes that "climate models may still be underestimating or missing relevant feedback processes"
additionally, climate models may be unable to adequately predict short-term regional climatic shifts
simplified model: energy flows between space, the atmosphere, and earth's surface, with greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorbing and emitting radiant heat, affecting earth's energy balance
data as of 2007 
a subset of climate models add societal factors to a simple physical climate model
these models simulate how population, economic growth, and energy use affect—and interact with—the physical climate
with this information, these models can produce scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions
this is then used as input for physical climate models and carbon cycle models to predict how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change
depending on the socioeconomic scenario and the mitigation scenario, models produce atmospheric co2 concentrations that range widely between 380 and 1400 ppm
the ipcc sixth assessment report projects that global warming is very likely to reach 1.0 °c to 1.8 °c by the late 21st century under the very low ghg emissions scenario
in an intermediate scenario global warming would reach 2.1 °c to 3.5 °c, and 3.3 °c to 5.7 °c under the very high ghg emissions scenario
these projections are based on climate models in combination with observations
the remaining carbon budget is determined by modelling the carbon cycle and the climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases
according to the ipcc, global warming can be kept below 1.5 °c with a two-thirds chance if emissions after 2018 do not exceed 420 or 570 gigatonnes of co2
this corresponds to 10 to 13 years of current emissions
there are high uncertainties about the budget
for instance, it may be 100 gigatonnes of co2 smaller due to methane release from permafrost and wetlands
however, it is clear that fossil fuel resources are too abundant for shortages to be relied on to limit carbon emissions in the 21st century
even though the temperature will need to stay at or above 1.5 °c for 20 years to pass the threshold defined by the paris agreement, a temporary rise above this limit also can have severe consequences
according to the world meteorological organization, there is a 66% chance that global temperature will rise temporarily above 1.5 °c in the years 2023–2027 
impacts main article: effects of climate change
the sixth ipcc assessment report projects changes in average soil moisture that can disrupt agriculture and ecosystems
a reduction in soil moisture by one standard deviation means that average soil moisture will approximately match the ninth driest year between 1850 and 1900 at that location
environmental effects further information: effects of climate change on oceans and effects of climate change on the water cycle the environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans, ice, and weather
changes may occur gradually or rapidly
evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past, from modelling, and from modern observations
since the 1950s, droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency
extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased in india and east asia
the rainfall rate and intensity of hurricanes and typhoons is likely increasing, and the geographic range likely expanding poleward in response to climate warming
frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased as a result of climate change
historical sea level reconstruction and projections up to 2100 published in 2017 by the u.s. global change research program global sea level is rising as a consequence of glacial melt, melt of the greenland ice sheets and antarctica, and thermal expansion
between 1993 and 2020, the rise increased over time, averaging 3.3 ± 0.3 mm per year
over the 21st century, the ipcc projects that in a very high emissions scenario the sea level could rise by 61–110 cm
increased ocean warmth is undermining and threatening to unplug antarctic glacier outlets, risking a large melt of the ice sheet and the possibility of a 2-meter sea level rise by 2100 under high emissions
climate change has led to decades of shrinking and thinning of the arctic sea ice
while ice-free summers are expected to be rare at 1.5 °c degrees of warming, they are set to occur once every three to ten years at a warming level of 2 °c
higher atmospheric co2 concentrations have led to changes in ocean chemistry
an increase in dissolved co2 is causing oceans to acidify
in addition, oxygen levels are decreasing as oxygen is less soluble in warmer water
dead zones in the ocean, regions with very little oxygen, are expanding too
tipping points and long-term impacts greater degrees of global warming increase the risk of passing through 'tipping points'—thresholds beyond which certain impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures are reduced
an example is the collapse of west antarctic and greenland ice sheets, where a temperature rise of 1.5 to 2 °c may commit the ice sheets to melt, although the time scale of melt is uncertain and depends on future warming
some large-scale changes could occur over a short time period, such as a shutdown of certain ocean currents like the atlantic meridional overturning circulation (amoc)
tipping points can also include irreversible damage to ecosystems like the amazon rainforest and coral reefs
the long-term effects of climate change on oceans include further ice melt, ocean warming, sea level rise, and ocean acidification
on the timescale of centuries to millennia, the magnitude of climate change will be determined primarily by anthropogenic co2 emissions
this is due to co2's long atmospheric lifetime
oceanic co2 uptake is slow enough that ocean acidification will continue for hundreds to thousands of years
these emissions are estimated to have prolonged the current interglacial period by at least 100,000 years
sea level rise will continue over many centuries, with an estimated rise of 2.3 metres per degree celsius (4.2 ft/°f) after 2000 years
nature and wildlife further information: effects of climate change on oceans and effects of climate change on ecosystems recent warming has driven many terrestrial and freshwater species poleward and towards higher altitudes
higher atmospheric co2 levels and an extended growing season have resulted in global greening
however, heatwaves and drought have reduced ecosystem productivity in some regions
the future balance of these opposing effects is unclear
climate change has contributed to the expansion of drier climate zones, such as the expansion of deserts in the subtropics
the size and speed of global warming is making abrupt changes in ecosystems more likely
overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species
the oceans have heated more slowly than the land, but plants and animals in the ocean have migrated towards the colder poles faster than species on land
just as on land, heat waves in the ocean occur more frequently due to climate change, harming a wide range of organisms such as corals, kelp, and seabirds
ocean acidification makes it harder for marine calcifying organisms such as mussels, barnacles and corals to produce shells and skeletons; and heatwaves have bleached coral reefs
harmful algal blooms enhanced by climate change and eutrophication lower oxygen levels, disrupt food webs and cause great loss of marine life
coastal ecosystems are under particular stress
almost half of global wetlands have disappeared due to climate change and other human impacts

humans main article: effects of climate change further information: effects of climate change on human health, climate security, economic analysis of climate change, and effects of climate change on agriculture
extreme weather will be progressively more common as the earth warms
the effects of climate change are impacting humans everywhere in the world
impacts can be observed on all continents and ocean regions, with low-latitude, less developed areas facing the greatest risk
continued warming has potentially "severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts" for people and ecosystems
the risks are unevenly distributed, but are generally greater for disadvantaged people in developing and developed countries
food and health the who calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century
extreme weather leads to injury and loss of life, and crop failures to malnutrition
various infectious diseases are more easily transmitted in a warmer climate, such as dengue fever and malaria
young children are the most vulnerable to food shortages
both children and older people are vulnerable to extreme heat
the world health organization (who) has estimated that between 2030 and 2050, climate change would cause around 250,000 additional deaths per year
they assessed deaths from heat exposure in elderly people, increases in diarrhea, malaria, dengue, coastal flooding, and childhood malnutrition
over 500,000 more adult deaths are projected yearly by 2050 due to reductions in food availability and quality
by 2100, 50% to 75% of the global population may face climate conditions that are life-threatening due to combined effects of extreme heat and humidity
climate change is affecting food security
it has caused reduction in global yields of maize, wheat, and soybeans between 1981 and 2010 
future warming could further reduce global yields of major crops
crop production will probably be negatively affected in low-latitude countries, while effects at northern latitudes may be positive or negative
up to an additional 183 million people worldwide, particularly those with lower incomes, are at risk of hunger as a consequence of these impacts
climate change also impacts fish populations
globally, less will be available to be fished
regions dependent on glacier water, regions that are already dry, and small islands have a higher risk of water stress due to climate change
livelihoods economic damages due to climate change may be severe and there is a chance of disastrous consequences
climate change has likely already increased global economic inequality, and this trend is projected to continue
most of the severe impacts are expected in sub-saharan africa, where most of the local inhabitants are dependent upon natural and agricultural resources and south-east asia
the world bank estimates that climate change could drive over 120 million people into poverty by 2030 
inequalities based on wealth and social status have worsened due to climate change
major difficulties in mitigating, adapting, and recovering to climate shocks are faced by marginalized people who have less control over resources
indigenous people, who are subsistent on their land and ecosystems, will face endangerment to their wellness and lifestyles due to climate change
an expert elicitation concluded that the role of climate change in armed conflict has been small compared to factors such as socio-economic inequality and state capabilities
low-lying islands and coastal communities are threatened by sea level rise, which makes flooding more common
sometimes, land is permanently lost to the sea
this could lead to statelessness for people in island nations, such as the maldives and tuvalu
in some regions, the rise in temperature and humidity may be too severe for humans to adapt to
with worst-case climate change, models project that almost one-third of humanity might live in extremely hot and uninhabitable climates, similar to the climate found in the sahara
these factors can drive climate or environmental migration, within and between countries
more people are expected to be displaced because of sea level rise, extreme weather and conflict from increased competition over natural resources
climate change may also increase vulnerability, leading to "trapped populations" who are not able to move due to a lack of resources

reducing and recapturing emissions main article: climate change mitigation
global greenhouse gas emission scenarios, based on policies and pledges as of november, 2021 climate change can be mitigated by reducing the rate at which greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere, and by increasing the rate at which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere
in order to limit global warming to less than 1.5 °c global greenhouse gas emissions needs to be net-zero by 2050, or by 2070 with a 2 °c target
this requires far-reaching, systemic changes on an unprecedented scale in energy, land, cities, transport, buildings, and industry
the united nations environment programme estimates that countries need to triple their pledges under the paris agreement within the next decade to limit global warming to 2 °c
an even greater level of reduction is required to meet the 1.5 °c goal
with pledges made under the paris agreement as of october 2021, global warming would still have a 66% chance of reaching about 2.7 °c (range: 2.2–3.2 °c) by the end of the century
globally, limiting warming to 2 °c may result in higher economic benefits than economic costs
although there is no single pathway to limit global warming to 1.5 or 2 °c, most scenarios and strategies see a major increase in the use of renewable energy in combination with increased energy efficiency measures to generate the needed greenhouse gas reductions
to reduce pressures on ecosystems and enhance their carbon sequestration capabilities, changes would also be necessary in agriculture and forestry, such as preventing deforestation and restoring natural ecosystems by reforestation
other approaches to mitigating climate change have a higher level of risk
scenarios that limit global warming to 1.5 °c typically project the large-scale use of carbon dioxide removal methods over the 21st century
there are concerns, though, about over-reliance on these technologies, and environmental impacts
solar radiation modification (srm) is also a possible supplement to deep reductions in emissions
however, srm raises significant ethical and legal concerns, and the risks are imperfectly understood
clean energy main articles: sustainable energy and sustainable transport
coal, oil, and natural gas remain the primary global energy sources even as renewables have begun rapidly increasing
wind and solar power, germany renewable energy is key to limiting climate change
for decades, fossil fuels have accounted for roughly 80% of the world's energy use
the remaining share has been split between nuclear power and renewables (including hydropower, bioenergy, wind and solar power and geothermal energy)
that mix is projected to change significantly over the next 30 years
fossil fuel use is expected to peak prior to 2030, and begin to decline by then
coal use will experience the sharpest decline
solar panels and onshore wind are now among the cheapest forms of adding new power generation capacity in many locations
renewables represented 75% of all new electricity generation installed in 2019, nearly all solar and wind
other forms of clean energy, such as nuclear and hydropower, currently have a larger share of the energy supply
however, their future growth forecasts appear limited in comparison
to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, renewable energy would become the dominant form of electricity generation, rising to 85% or more by 2050 in some scenarios
investment in coal would be eliminated and coal use nearly phased out by 2050 
electricity generated from renewable sources would also need to become the main energy source for heating and transport
transport can switch away from internal combustion engine vehicles and towards electric vehicles, public transit, and active transport (cycling and walking)
for shipping and flying, low-carbon fuels would reduce emissions
heating could be increasingly decarbonised with technologies like heat pumps
there are obstacles to the continued rapid growth of clean energy, including renewables
for wind and solar, there are environmental and land use concerns for new projects
wind and solar also produce energy intermittently and with seasonal variability
traditionally, hydro dams with reservoirs and conventional power plants have been used when variable energy production is low
going forward, battery storage can be expanded, energy demand and supply can be matched, and long-distance transmission can smooth variability of renewable outputs
bioenergy is often not carbon-neutral and may have negative consequences for food security
the growth of nuclear power is constrained by controversy around radioactive waste, nuclear weapon proliferation, and accidents
hydropower growth is limited by the fact that the best sites have been developed, and new projects are confronting increased social and environmental concerns
low-carbon energy improves human health by minimising climate change
it also has the near-term benefit of reducing air pollution deaths, which were estimated at 7 million annually in 2016 
meeting the paris agreement goals that limit warming to a 2 °c increase could save about a million of those lives per year by 2050, whereas limiting global warming to 1.5 °c could save millions and simultaneously increase energy security and reduce poverty
improving air quality also has economic benefits which may be larger than mitigation costs
energy conservation main articles: efficient energy use and energy conservation reducing energy demand is another major aspect of reducing emissions
if less energy is needed, there is more flexibility for clean energy development
it also makes it easier to manage the electricity grid, and minimises carbon-intensive infrastructure development
major increases in energy efficiency investment will be required to achieve climate goals, comparable to the level of investment in renewable energy
several covid-19 related changes in energy use patterns, energy efficiency investments, and funding have made forecasts for this decade more difficult and uncertain
strategies to reduce energy demand vary by sector
in the transport sector, passengers and freight can switch to more efficient travel modes, such as buses and trains, or use electric vehicles
industrial strategies to reduce energy demand include improving heating systems and motors, designing less energy-intensive products, and increasing product lifetimes
in the building sector the focus is on better design of new buildings, and higher levels of energy efficiency in retrofitting
the use of technologies like heat pumps can also increase building energy efficiency
agriculture and industry see also: sustainable agriculture and green industrial policy
taking into account direct and indirect emissions, industry is the sector with the highest share of global emissions
data as of 2019 from the ipcc
agriculture and forestry face a triple challenge of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, preventing the further conversion of forests to agricultural land, and meeting increases in world food demand
a set of actions could reduce agriculture and forestry-based emissions by two thirds from 2010 levels
these include reducing growth in demand for food and other agricultural products, increasing land productivity, protecting and restoring forests, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production
on the demand side, a key component of reducing emissions is shifting people towards plant-based diets
eliminating the production of livestock for meat and dairy would eliminate about 3/4ths of all emissions from agriculture and other land use
livestock also occupy 37% of ice-free land area on earth and consume feed from the 12% of land area used for crops, driving deforestation and land degradation
steel and cement production are responsible for about 13% of industrial co2 emissions
in these industries, carbon-intensive materials such as coke and lime play an integral role in the production, so that reducing co2 emissions requires research into alternative chemistries
carbon sequestration main articles: carbon dioxide removal and carbon sequestration
most co2 emissions have been absorbed by carbon sinks, including plant growth, soil uptake, and ocean uptake (2020 global carbon budget)
natural carbon sinks can be enhanced to sequester significantly larger amounts of co2 beyond naturally occurring levels
reforestation and tree planting on non-forest lands are among the most mature sequestration techniques, although the latter raises food security concerns
farmers can promote sequestration of carbon in soils through practices such as use of winter cover crops, reducing the intensity and frequency of tillage, and using compost and manure as soil amendments
in one of its recent publications, fao maintains that forest and landscape restoration yields many benefits for the climate, including greenhouse gas emissions sequestration and reduction
restoration/recreation of coastal wetlands, prairie plots and seagrass meadows increases the uptake of carbon into organic matter
when carbon is sequestered in soils and in organic matter such as trees, there is a risk of the carbon being re-released into the atmosphere later through changes in land use, fire, or other changes in ecosystems
where energy production or co2-intensive heavy industries continue to produce waste co2, the gas can be captured and stored instead of released to the atmosphere
although its current use is limited in scale and expensive, carbon capture and storage (ccs) may be able to play a significant role in limiting co2 emissions by mid-century
this technique, in combination with bioenergy (beccs) can result in net negative emissions: co2 is drawn from the atmosphere
it remains highly uncertain whether carbon dioxide removal techniques will be able to play a large role in limiting warming to 1.5 °c
policy decisions that rely on carbon dioxide removal increase the risk of global warming rising beyond international goals
adaptation main article: climate change adaptation adaptation is "the process of adjustment to current or expected changes in climate and its effects"
: 5 without additional mitigation, adaptation cannot avert the risk of "severe, widespread and irreversible" impacts
more severe climate change requires more transformative adaptation, which can be prohibitively expensive
the capacity and potential for humans to adapt is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less
the first two decades of the 21st century saw an increase in adaptive capacity in most low- and middle-income countries with improved access to basic sanitation and electricity, but progress is slow
many countries have implemented adaptation policies
however, there is a considerable gap between necessary and available finance
adaptation to sea level rise consists of avoiding at-risk areas, learning to live with increased flooding and protection
if that fails, managed retreat may be needed
there are economic barriers for tackling dangerous heat impact
avoiding strenuous work or having air conditioning is not possible for everybody
in agriculture, adaptation options include a switch to more sustainable diets, diversification, erosion control and genetic improvements for increased tolerance to a changing climate
insurance allows for risk-sharing, but is often difficult to get for people on lower incomes
education, migration and early warning systems can reduce climate vulnerability
planting mangroves or encouraging other coastal vegetation can buffer storms
ecosystems adapt to climate change, a process that can be supported by human intervention
by increasing connectivity between ecosystems, species can migrate to more favourable climate conditions
species can also be introduced to areas acquiring a favorable climate
protection and restoration of natural and semi-natural areas helps build resilience, making it easier for ecosystems to adapt
many of the actions that promote adaptation in ecosystems, also help humans adapt via ecosystem-based adaptation
for instance, restoration of natural fire regimes makes catastrophic fires less likely, and reduces human exposure
giving rivers more space allows for more water storage in the natural system, reducing flood risk
restored forest acts as a carbon sink, but planting trees in unsuitable regions can exacerbate climate impacts
there are synergies but also trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation
an example for synergy is increased food productivity which has large benefits for both adaptation and mitigation
two examples for trade-offs include: firstly, the increased use of air conditioning allows people to better cope with heat, but increases energy demand
secondly, more compact urban development may lead to reduced emissions from transport and construction which is good
but at the same time, this kind of urban development may increase the urban heat island effect, leading to higher temperatures and increased exposure of people to heat-related health risks
examples of adaptation methods mangrove planting and other habitat conservation can reduce coastal flooding
mangrove planting and other habitat conservation can reduce coastal flooding

policies and politics see also: politics of climate change and climate change mitigation § policies
the climate change performance index ranks countries by greenhouse gas emissions (40% of score), renewable energy (20%), energy use (20%), and climate policy (20%)
high medium low very low countries that are most vulnerable to climate change have typically been responsible for a small share of global emissions
this raises questions about justice and fairness
climate change is strongly linked to sustainable development
limiting global warming makes it easier to achieve sustainable development goals, such as eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities
the connection is recognised in sustainable development goal 13 which is to "take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts"
the goals on food, clean water and ecosystem protection have synergies with climate mitigation
the geopolitics of climate change is complex
it has often been framed as a free-rider problem, in which all countries benefit from mitigation done by other countries, but individual countries would lose from switching to a low-carbon economy themselves
this framing has been challenged
for instance, the benefits of a coal phase-out to public health and local environments exceed the costs in almost all regions
furthermore, net importers of fossil fuels win economically from switching to clean energy, causing net exporters to face stranded assets: fossil fuels they cannot sell
policy options a wide range of policies, regulations, and laws are being used to reduce emissions
as of 2019, carbon pricing covers about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions
carbon can be priced with carbon taxes and emissions trading systems
direct global fossil fuel subsidies reached $319 billion in 2017, and $5.2 trillion when indirect costs such as air pollution are priced in
ending these can cause a 28% reduction in global carbon emissions and a 46% reduction in air pollution deaths
money saved on fossil subsidies could be used to support the transition to clean energy instead
more direct methods to reduce greenhouse gases include vehicle efficiency standards, renewable fuel standards, and air pollution regulations on heavy industry
several countries require utilities to increase the share of renewables in power production
climate justice policy designed through the lens of climate justice tries to address human rights issues and social inequality
for instance, wealthy nations responsible for the largest share of emissions would have to pay poorer countries to adapt
a 2023 study published in one earth estimated that the top 21 fossil fuel companies would owe cumulative climate reparations of $5.4 trillion over the period 2025–2050 
as the use of fossil fuels is reduced, jobs in the sector are lost
to achieve a just transition, these people would need to be retrained for other jobs
communities with many fossil fuel workers would need additional investments
international climate agreements further information: united nations framework convention on climate change
since 2000, rising co2 emissions in china and the rest of world have surpassed the output of the united states and europe
per person, the united states generates co2 at a far faster rate than other primary regions
nearly all countries in the world are parties to the 1994 united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc)
the goal of the unfccc is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system
as stated in the convention, this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilised in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can be sustained
the unfccc does not itself restrict emissions but rather provides a framework for protocols that do
global emissions have risen since the unfccc was signed
its yearly conferences are the stage of global negotiations
the 1997 kyoto protocol extended the unfccc and included legally binding commitments for most developed countries to limit their emissions
during the negotiations, the g77 (representing developing countries) pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to "[take] the lead" in reducing their emissions, since developed countries contributed most to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
per-capita emissions were also still relatively low in developing countries and developing countries would need to emit more to meet their development needs
the 2009 copenhagen accord has been widely portrayed as disappointing because of its low goals, and was rejected by poorer nations including the g77
associated parties aimed to limit the global temperature rise to below 2 °c
the accord set the goal of sending $100 billion per year to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation by 2020, and proposed the founding of the green climate fund
as of 2020, only 83.3 billion were delivered
only in 2023 the target is expected to be achieved
in 2015 all un countries negotiated the paris agreement, which aims to keep global warming well below 2.0 °c and contains an aspirational goal of keeping warming under 1.5 °c
the agreement replaced the kyoto protocol
unlike kyoto, no binding emission targets were set in the paris agreement
instead, a set of procedures was made binding
countries have to regularly set ever more ambitious goals and reevaluate these goals every five years
the paris agreement restated that developing countries must be financially supported
as of october 2021, 194 states and the european union have signed the treaty and 191 states and the eu have ratified or acceded to the agreement
the 1987 montreal protocol, an international agreement to stop emitting ozone-depleting gases, may have been more effective at curbing greenhouse gas emissions than the kyoto protocol specifically designed to do so
the 2016 kigali amendment to the montreal protocol aims to reduce the emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, a group of powerful greenhouse gases which served as a replacement for banned ozone-depleting gases
this made the montreal protocol a stronger agreement against climate change
national responses in 2019, the united kingdom parliament became the first national government to declare a climate emergency
other countries and jurisdictions followed suit
that same year, the european parliament declared a "climate and environmental emergency"
the european commission presented its european green deal with the goal of making the eu carbon-neutral by 2050 
major countries in asia have made similar pledges: south korea and japan have committed to become carbon-neutral by 2050, and china by 2060 
in 2021, the european commission released its "fit for 55" legislation package, which contains guidelines for the car industry; all new cars on the european market must be zero-emission vehicles from 2035 
while india has strong incentives for renewables, it also plans a significant expansion of coal in the country
vietnam is among very few coal-dependent fast developing countries that pledged to phase out unabated coal power by the 2040s or as soon as possible thereafter
as of 2021, based on information from 48 national climate plans, which represent 40% of the parties to the paris agreement, estimated total greenhouse gas emissions will be 0.5% lower compared to 2010 levels, below the 45% or 25% reduction goals to limit global warming to 1.5 °c or 2 °c, respectively
society denial and misinformation further information: global warming controversy, fossil fuels lobby, climate change denial, and climate change conspiracy theory
data has been cherry picked from short periods to falsely assert that global temperatures are not rising
blue trendlines show short periods that mask longer-term warming trends (red trendlines)
blue dots show the so-called global warming hiatus
public debate about climate change has been strongly affected by climate change denial and misinformation, which originated in the united states and has since spread to other countries, particularly canada and australia
the actors behind climate change denial form a well-funded and relatively coordinated coalition of fossil fuel companies, industry groups, conservative think tanks, and contrarian scientists
like the tobacco industry, the main strategy of these groups has been to manufacture doubt about scientific data and results
many who deny, dismiss, or hold unwarranted doubt about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change are labelled as "climate change skeptics", which several scientists have noted is a misnomer
there are different variants of climate denial: some deny that warming takes place at all, some acknowledge warming but attribute it to natural influences, and some minimise the negative impacts of climate change
manufacturing uncertainty about the science later developed into a manufactured controversy: creating the belief that there is significant uncertainty about climate change within the scientific community in order to delay policy changes
strategies to promote these ideas include criticism of scientific institutions, and questioning the motives of individual scientists
an echo chamber of climate-denying blogs and media has further fomented misunderstanding of climate change
public awareness and opinion further information: climate communication, media coverage of climate change, and public opinion on climate change
the public substantially underestimates the degree of scientific consensus that humans are causing climate change
studies from 2019 to 2021 found scientific consensus to range from 98.7 to 100%
climate change came to international public attention in the late 1980s
due to media coverage in the early 1990s, people often confused climate change with other environmental issues like ozone depletion
in popular culture, the climate fiction movie the day after tomorrow (2004) and the al gore documentary an inconvenient truth (2006) focused on climate change
significant regional, gender, age and political differences exist in both public concern for, and understanding of, climate change
more highly educated people, and in some countries, women and younger people, were more likely to see climate change as a serious threat
partisan gaps also exist in many countries, and countries with high co2 emissions tend to be less concerned
views on causes of climate change vary widely between countries
concern has increased over time, to the point where in 2021 a majority of citizens in many countries express a high level of worry about climate change, or view it as a global emergency
higher levels of worry are associated with stronger public support for policies that address climate change
climate movement main articles: climate movement and climate change litigation climate protests demand that political leaders take action to prevent climate change
they can take the form of public demonstrations, fossil fuel divestment, lawsuits and other activities
prominent demonstrations include the school strike for climate
in this initiative, young people across the globe have been protesting since 2018 by skipping school on fridays, inspired by swedish teenager greta thunberg
mass civil disobedience actions by groups like extinction rebellion have protested by disrupting roads and public transport
litigation is increasingly used as a tool to strengthen climate action from public institutions and companies
activists also initiate lawsuits which target governments and demand that they take ambitious action or enforce existing laws on climate change
lawsuits against fossil-fuel companies generally seek compensation for loss and damage
history for broader coverage of this topic, see history of climate change science
early discoveries
this 1912 article succinctly describes the greenhouse effect, how burning coal creates carbon dioxide to cause global warming and climate change
scientists in the 19th century such as alexander von humboldt began to foresee the effects of climate change
in the 1820s, joseph fourier proposed the greenhouse effect to explain why earth's temperature was higher than the sun's energy alone could explain
earth's atmosphere is transparent to sunlight, so sunlight reaches the surface where it is converted to heat
however, the atmosphere is not transparent to heat radiating from the surface, and captures some of that heat, which in turn warms the planet
in 1856 eunice newton foote demonstrated that the warming effect of the sun is greater for air with water vapour than for dry air, and that the effect is even greater with carbon dioxide (co2)
she concluded that "an atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature."
starting in 1859, john tyndall established that nitrogen and oxygen—together totaling 99% of dry air—are transparent to radiated heat
however, water vapour and gases such as methane and carbon dioxide absorb radiated heat and re-radiate that heat into the atmosphere
tyndall proposed that changes in the concentrations of these gases may have caused climatic changes in the past, including ice ages
svante arrhenius noted that water vapour in air continuously varied, but the co2 concentration in air was influenced by long-term geological processes
warming from increased co2 levels would increase the amount of water vapour, amplifying warming in a positive feedback loop
in 1896, he published the first climate model of its kind, projecting that halving co2 levels could have produced a drop in temperature initiating an ice age
arrhenius calculated the temperature increase expected from doubling co2 to be around 5–6 °c
other scientists were initially skeptical and believed that the greenhouse effect was saturated so that adding more co2 would make no difference, and that the climate would be self-regulating
beginning in 1938, guy stewart callendar published evidence that climate was warming and co2 levels were rising, but his calculations met the same objections
development of a scientific consensus see also: scientific consensus on climate change in the 1950s, gilbert plass created a detailed computer model that included different atmospheric layers and the infrared spectrum
this model predicted that increasing co2 levels would cause warming
around the same time, hans suess found evidence that co2 levels had been rising, and roger revelle showed that the oceans would not absorb the increase
the two scientists subsequently helped charles keeling to begin a record of continued increase, which has been termed the "keeling curve"
scientists alerted the public, and the dangers were highlighted at james hansen's 1988 congressional testimony
the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), set up in 1988 to provide formal advice to the world's governments, spurred interdisciplinary research
as part of the ipcc reports, scientists assess the scientific discussion that takes place in peer-reviewed journal articles
there is a near-complete scientific consensus that the climate is warming and that this is caused by human activities
as of 2019, agreement in recent literature reached over 99%
no scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view
consensus has further developed that some form of action should be taken to protect people against the impacts of climate change
national science academies have called on world leaders to cut global emissions
the 2021 ipcc assessment report stated that it is "unequivocal" that climate change is caused by humans
climate change
climate change is the climate of earth changing
the earth's climate has been much hotter and colder than it is today
climate change this century and last century is sometimes called global warming, because the average temperature on the surface has risen
the last decade (2011–2020) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850 
the climate is now changing much faster than it has in the recent past
this is because people are putting more greenhouse gases in earth's atmosphere, and they block some heat from escaping from the earth into space
when people talk about climate change they are usually talking about the problem of human-caused global warming, which is happening now (see global warming for more details)
but the climate of the earth has changed over not just thousands of years, but tens or hundreds of millions of years
sometimes, before there were people, the earth's climate was much hotter than it is today
for example about 60 million years ago there were a lot of volcanoes, which burnt a lot of underground organic matter (squashed and fossilized dead plants and animals like coal, gas and oil)
a lot of carbon dioxide and methane went up in the air
at times in the past, the temperature was much cooler, with the last glaciation ending about ten thousand years ago
ice ages are times when the earth got colder, and more ice froze at the north and south poles
sometimes even the whole earth has been covered in ice, and was much colder than today
there is no one reason why there are ice ages
changes in the earth's orbit around the sun, and the sun getting brighter or dimmer are events which do happen
also how much the earth is tilted compared to the sun might make a difference
another source of change is the activities of living things (see great oxygenation event and huronian glaciation)
hot earth sometimes, before there were people, the earth's climate was much hotter than it is today
for example about 60 million years ago there were a lot of volcanoes, which burnt a lot of underground organic matter (squashed and fossilized dead plants and animals like coal, gas and oil) so a lot of carbon dioxide and methane went up in the air like nowadays
this made the earth hot enough for giant tortoises and alligators to live in the arctic
cold earth glaciations at times in the past, the temperature was much cooler, with the last glaciation ending about ten thousand years ago
ice ages ice ages are long times (much much longer than glaciations) when the earth got colder, and more ice froze at the north and south poles
sometimes even the whole earth was covered in ice, and was much colder than today
there is no one reason why there are ice ages
changes in the earth's orbit around the sun, and the sun getting brighter or dimmer are events which do happen
also how much the earth is tilted compared to the sun might make a difference
another source of change is the activities of living things (see great oxygenation event and huronian glaciation)
history of climate change studies joseph fourier in 1824, claude pouillet in 1827 and 1838, eunice foote (1819–1888) in 1856, irish physicist john tyndall (1820–1893) in 1863 onwards, svante arrhenius in 1896, and guy stewart callendar (1898–1964) discovered the importance of carbon dioxide (co2) in climate change
foote's work was not appreciated, and not widely known
tyndall proved there were other greenhouse gases as well
nils gustaf ekholm in 1901 invented the term
the sun the sun gets a little bit hotter and colder every 11 years
this is called the 11-year sunspot cycle
the change is so small that scientists can barely measure how it affects the temperature of the earth
if the sun was causing the earth to warm up, it would warm both the surface and high up in the air
but the air in the upper stratosphere is actually getting colder
therefore the changes in the sun are not causing the global warming which is happening now
according to the united nations’ intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), the current scientific consensus is that long and short-term variations in solar activity play only a very small role in earth’s climate
warming from increased levels of human-produced greenhouse gases is actually many times stronger than any effects due to recent variations in solar activity
for more than 40 years, satellites have observed the sun's energy output, which has gone up or down by less than 0.1 percent during that period
since 1750, the warming driven by greenhouse gases coming from the human burning of fossil fuels is over 270 times greater than the slight extra warming coming from the sun itself over that same time 
sustainable energy and environment renewable energy or sustainable energy includes any energy source that cannot be exhausted
it can remain viable for a long period of time without running out or lasts forever
examples are solar, wind, hydropower (water), geothermal, tidal and biomass
sustainable energy choices play a crucial role in mitigating the impact of human activities on the environment
here's an overview of some key sustainable energy options and their environmental impacts according to research:
solar energy sunlight from the sun when converted produces solar energy
it is in abundance and freely available
the type of energy obtained is clean and easily renewable
it has low maintenance cost and can generate energy in any climate
wind energy another clean form of energy is wind
this energy is a plentiful source of renewable energy source
however, it is only available sometimes
through history, the use of wind power has waxed and waned, from the use of windmills in centuries past to high tech wind turbines on wind farms today
effects of climate change
for effects of changes in climate prior to the current period of global warming, see historical climatology
thick orange-brown smoke blocks half a blue sky, with conifers in the foreground a few grey fish swim over grey coral with white spikes desert sand half covers a village of small flat-roofed houses with scattered green trees large areas of still water behind riverside buildings some climate change effects: wildfire caused by heat and dryness, bleached coral caused by ocean acidification and heating, environmental migration caused by desertification, and coastal flooding caused by storms and sea level rise
the primary causes and the wide-ranging impacts: 3–36 of climate change
some effects act as positive feedbacks that intensify climate change
climate change affects the physical environment, ecosystems and human societies
changes in the climate system include an overall warming trend, more extreme weather and rising sea levels
these in turn impact nature and wildlife, as well as human settlements and societies
the effects of human-caused climate change are broad and far-reaching
this is especially so if there is no significant climate action
experts sometimes describe the projected and observed negative impacts of climate change as the climate crisis
the changes in climate are not uniform across the earth
in particular, most land areas have warmed faster than most ocean areas
the arctic is warming faster than most other regions
there are many effects of climate change on oceans
these include an increase in ocean temperatures, a rise in sea level from ocean warming and ice sheet melting
they include increased ocean stratification
they also include changes to ocean currents including a weakening of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation
: 10 carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is acidifiying the ocean
recent warming has had a big effect on natural biological systems
it has degraded land by raising temperatures, drying soils and increasing wildfire risk
: 9 species all over the world are migrating towards the poles to colder areas
on land, many species move to higher ground, whereas marine species seek colder water at greater depths
at 2 °c (3.6 °f) of warming, around 10% of species on land would become critically endangered.: 259 
food security and access to fresh water are at risk due to rising temperatures
climate change has profound impacts on human health
these can be direct impacts via heat stress
they can be indirect changes via the spread of infectious diseases
humans are vulnerable and exposed to climate change in different ways
this varies by economic sector and by country
wealthy industrialised countries, which have emitted the most co2, have more resources
so they are the least vulnerable to global warming
climate change affects many economic sectors
they include agriculture, fisheries, forestry, energy, insurance, and tourism
some groups may be particularly at risk from climate change, such as the poor, women, children and indigenous peoples
climate change can lead to displacement and changes in migration flows
changes in temperature further information: global surface temperature, instrumental temperature record, and heat wave
average surface air temperatures from 2011 to 2021 compared to the 1956–1976 average
source: nasa global warming affects all parts of earth's climate system
global surface temperatures have risen by 1.1 °c (2.0 °f)
scientists say they will rise further in the future
the changes in climate are not uniform across the earth
in particular, most land areas have warmed faster than most ocean areas
the arctic is warming faster than most other regions
night-time temperatures have increased faster than daytime temperatures
the impact on nature and people depends on how much more the earth warms
scientists use several methods to predict the effects of human-caused climate change
one is to investigate past natural changes in climate
to assess changes in earth's past climate scientists have studied tree rings, ice cores, corals, and ocean and lake sediments
these show that recent temperatures have surpassed anything in the last 2,000 years
by the end of the 21st century, temperatures may increase to a level last seen in the mid-pliocene
this was around 3 million years ago
at that time, mean global temperatures were about 2–4 °c (3.6–7.2 °f) warmer than pre-industrial temperatures
the global mean sea level was up to 25 meters higher than it is today
: 323 the modern observed rise in temperature and co2 concentrations has been rapid
even abrupt geophysical events in earth's history do not approach current rates.: 54 
how much the world warms depends on human greenhouse gas emissions and how sensitive the climate is to greenhouse gases
the more carbon dioxide (co2) is emitted in the 21st century the hotter the world will be by 2100 
for a doubling of greenhouse gas concentrations, the global mean temperature would rise by about 2.5–4 °c (4.5–7.2 °f)
what would happen if emissions of co2 stopped abruptly and there was no use of negative emission technologies?
the earth's climate would not start moving back to its pre-industrial state
temperatures would stay at the same high level for several centuries
after about a thousand years, 20% to 30% of human-emitted co2 would remain in the atmosphere
the ocean and land would not have taken them
this would commit the climate to a warmer state long after emissions have stopped
with current mitigation policies the temperature will be about 2.7 °c (2.0–3.6 °c) above pre-industrial levels by 2100 
it would rise to 2.4 °c (4.3 °f) if governments achieve all unconditional pledges and targets they have made
if all the countries that have set or are considering net-zero targets achieve them, the temperature will rise by around 1.8 °c (3.2 °f)
there is a big gap between national plans and commitments and the actions that governments have taken around the world
weather the lower and middle atmosphere, where nearly all weather occurs, are heating due to the greenhouse effect
evaporation and atmospheric moisture content increase as temperatures rise
water vapour is a greenhouse gas, so this process is a self-reinforcing feedback
the excess water vapour also gets caught up in storms
this makes them more intense, larger, and potentially longer-lasting
this in turn causes rain and snow events to become stronger and leads to increased risk of flooding
extra drying worsens natural dry spells and droughts
this increases risk of heat waves and wildfires
scientists have identified human activities as the cause of recent climate trends
they are now able to estimate the impact of climate change on extreme weather events
they call this process extreme event attribution
for instance such research can look at historical data for a region and conclude that a specific heat wave was more intense due to climate change
in addition , the time shifts of the season onsets, changes in the lenght of the saeson durations have been reported in many regions of the world
as a result of this, the timing of the extreme weather events such as heavy precipitaions and heat waves is changing in parallel with season shifting
heat waves and temperature extremes see also: heat wave
new high temperature records have outpaced new low temperature records on a growing portion of earth's surface
large increases in both the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (for increasing degrees of global warming) are expected.: 18 
map of increasing heatwave trends (frequency and cumulative intensity) over the midlatitudes and europe, july–august 1979–2020 heatwaves over land have become more frequent and more intense in almost all world regions since the 1950s, due to climate change
heat waves are more likely to occur simultaneously with droughts
marine heatwaves are twice as likely as they were in 1980 
climate change will lead to more very hot days and fewer very cold days
: 7 there are fewer cold waves.: 8 
experts can often attribute the intensity of individual heat waves to global warming
some extreme events would have been nearly impossible without human influence on the climate system
a heatwave that would occur once every ten years before global warming started now occurs 2.8 times as often
under further warming, heatwaves are set to become more frequent
an event that would occur every ten years would occur every other year if global warming reaches 2 °c (3.6 °f)
heat stress is related to temperature
it also increases if humidity is higher
the wet-bulb temperature measures both temperature and humidity
humans cannot adapt to a wet-bulb temperature above 35 °c (95 °f)
this heat stress can kill people
if global warming is kept below 1.5 or 2 °c (2.7 or 3.6 °f), it will probably be possible to avoid this deadly heat and humidity in most of the tropics
but there may still be negative health impacts
there is some evidence climate change is leading to a weakening of the polar vortex
this would make the jet stream more wavy
this would lead to outbursts of very cold winter weather across parts of eurasia and north america and incursions of very warm air into the arctic
rain main article: effects of climate change on the water cycle warming increases global average precipitation
precipitation is when water vapour condenses out of clouds, such as rain and snow
: 1057 higher temperatures increase evaporation and surface drying
as the air warms it can hold more water
for every degree celsius it can hold 7% more water vapour
: 1057 scientists have observed changes in the amount, intensity, frequency, and type of precipitation
overall, climate change is causing longer hot dry spells, broken by more intense rainfall.: 151, 154 
climate change has increased contrasts in rainfall amounts between wet and dry seasons
wet seasons are getting wetter and dry seasons are getting drier
in the northern high latitudes, warming has also caused an increase in the amount of snow and rain
: 1057 in the southern hemisphere, the rain associated with the storm tracks has shifted south
changes in monsoons vary a lot
more monsoon systems are becoming wetter than drier
in asia summer monsoons are getting wetter
the west african monsoon is getting wetter over the central sahel, and drier in the far western sahel.: 1058 
extreme storms
new orleans submerged after hurricane katrina, september 2005 storms become wetter under climate change
these include tropical cyclones and extratropical cyclones
both the maximum and mean rainfall rates increase
this more extreme rainfall is also true for thunderstorms in some regions
furthermore, tropical cyclones and storm tracks are moving towards the poles
this means some regions will see large changes in maximum wind speeds
scientists expect there will be fewer tropical cyclones
but they expect their strength to increase
there has probably been an increase in the number of tropical cyclones that intensify rapidly
impacts on land floods
the global average sea level has risen about 250 millimetres (9.8 in) since 1880, increasing the elevation on top of which other types of flooding (high-tide flooding, storm surge) occur
long-term sea level rise occurs in addition to intermittent tidal flooding
noaa predicts different levels of sea level rise for coastlines within a single country
due to an increase in heavy rainfall events, floods are likely to become more severe when they do occur
: 1155 the interactions between rainfall and flooding are complex
there are some regions in which flooding is expected to become rarer
this depends on several factors
these include changes in rain and snowmelt, but also soil moisture
: 1156 climate change leaves soils drier in some areas, so they may absorb rainfall more quickly
this leads to less flooding
dry soils can also become harder
in this case heavy rainfall runs off into rivers and lakes
this increases risks of flooding.: 1155 
droughts
a dry lakebed in california
in 2022, the state was experiencing its most serious drought in 1,200 years, worsened by climate change
climate change affects many factors associated with droughts
these include how much rain falls and how fast the rain evaporates again
warming over land increases the severity and frequency of droughts around much of the world
: 1057 in some tropical and subtropical regions of the world, there will probably be less rain due to global warming
this will make them more prone to drought
droughts are set to worsen in many regions of the world
these include central america, the amazon and south-western south america
they also include west and southern africa
the mediterranean and south-western australia are also some of these regions.: 1157 
higher temperatures increase evaporation
this dries the soil and increases plant stress
agriculture suffers as a result
this means even regions where overall rainfall is expected to remain relatively stable will experience these impacts
: 1157 these regions include central and northern europe
without climate change mitigation, around one third of land areas are likely to experience moderate or more severe drought by 2100.: 1157 due to global warming droughts are more frequent and intense than in the past
several impacts make their impacts worse
these are increased water demand, population growth and urban expansion in many areas
land restoration can help reduce the impact of droughts
one example of this is agroforestry
wildfires further information: wildfire § climate change effects
wildfire disasters (those claiming at least 10 lives or affecting over 100 people) have increased substantially in recent decades
climate change intensifies heatwaves and droughts that dry vegetation, which in turn fuels wildfires
climate change promotes the type of weather that makes wildfires more likely
in some areas, an increase of wildfires has been attributed directly to climate change
evidence from earth's past also shows more fire in warmer periods.climate change increases evaporation
this can cause vegetation to dry out
when a fire starts in an area with very dry vegetation, it can spread rapidly
higher temperatures can also lengthen the fire season
this is the time of year in which severe wildfires are most likely, particularly in regions where snow is disappearing
weather conditions are raising the risks of wildfires
but the total area burnt by wildfires has decreased
this is mostly because savanna has been converted to cropland, so there are fewer trees to burn
prescribed burning isan indigenous practice in the us and australia
it can reduce wildfire burning
the carbon released from wildfires can add to greenhouse gas concentrations
climate models do not yet full reflect this feedback.: 20 
oceans
oceans have taken up almost 90% of the excess heat accumulated on earth due to global warming
part of the great barrier reef in australia in 2016 after a coral bleaching event this section is an excerpt from effects of climate change on oceans
[edit] there are many effects of climate change on oceans
one of the main ones is an increase in ocean temperatures
more frequent marine heatwaves are linked to this
the rising temperature contributes to a rise in sea levels
other effects include ocean acidification, sea ice decline, increased ocean stratification and reductions in oxygen levels
changes to ocean currents including a weakening of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation are another important effect
all these changes have knock-on effects which disturb marine ecosystems
the main cause of these changes is climate change due to human emissions of greenhouse gases
carbon dioxide and methane are examples of greenhouse gases
this leads to ocean warming, because the ocean takes up most of the additional heat in the climate system
the ocean absorbs some of the extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
this causes the ph value of the ocean to drop
scientists estimate that the ocean absorbs about 25% of all human-caused co2 emissions
ocean temperature stratification is the difference in temperature between the various layers of the ocean
it increases as the ocean surface warms due to rising air temperatures
: 471 the decline in mixing of the ocean layers stabilizes warm water near the surface
it also reduces cold, deep water circulation
the reduced vertical mixing makes it harder for the ocean to absorb heat
so a larger share of future warming goes into the atmosphere and land
one result is an increase in the amount of energy available for tropical cyclones and other storms
another result is a decrease in nutrients for fish in the upper ocean layers
these changes also reduce the ocean's capacity to store carbon
at the same time, contrasts in salinity are increasing
salty areas are becoming saltier and fresher areas less salty
warmer water cannot contain the same amount of oxygen as cold water
as a result, oxygen from the oceans moves to the atmosphere
increased thermal stratification may reduce the supply of oxygen from surface waters to deeper waters
this lowers the water's oxygen content even more
the ocean has already lost oxygen throughout its water column
oxygen minimum zones are expanding worldwide
: 471 sea level rise this section is an excerpt from sea level rise
[edit] between 1901 and 2018, the average global sea level rose by 15–25 cm (6–10 in), or an average of 1–2 mm per year
this rate accelerated to 4.62 mm/yr for the decade 2013–2022 
climate change due to human activities is the main cause
between 1993 and 2018, thermal expansion of water accounted for 42% of sea level rise
melting temperate glaciers accounted for 21%, with greenland accounting for 15% and antarctica 8%
: 1576 sea level rise lags changes in the earth's temperature
so sea level rise will continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that is already happening
what happens after that will depend on what happens with human greenhouse gas emissions
sea level rise may slow down between 2050 and 2100 if there are deep cuts in emissions
it could then reach a little over 30 cm (1 ft) from now by 2100 
with high emissions it may accelerate
it could rise by 1 m (3+1⁄2 ft) or even 2 m (6+1⁄2 ft) by then
in the long run, sea level rise would amount to 2–3 m (7–10 ft) over the next 2000 years if warming amounts to 1.5 °c (2.7 °f)
it would be 19–22 metres (62–72 ft) if warming peaks at 5 °c (9.0 °f).: 21 
rising seas ultimately impact every coastal and island population on earth
this can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and tsunamis
these have many knock-on effects
they lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves
crop production falls because of salinization of irrigation water and damage to ports disrupts sea trade
the sea level rise projected by 2050 will expose places currently inhabited by tens of millions of people to annual flooding
without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, this may increase to hundreds of millions in the latter decades of the century
areas not directly exposed to rising sea levels could be affected by large scale migrations and economic disruption
ice and snow see also: special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate
earth lost 28 trillion tonnes of ice between 1994 and 2017, with melting grounded ice (ice sheets and glaciers) raising the global sea level by 34.6 ±3.1 mm
the rate of ice loss has risen by 57% since the 1990s−from 0.8 to 1.2 trillion tonnes per year
melting of glacial mass is approximately linearly related to temperature rise
shrinkage of snow cover duration in the alps, starting ca
end of the 19th century, highlighting climate change adaptation needs the cryosphere, the area of the earth covered by snow or ice, is extremely sensitive to changes in global climate
there has been an extensive loss of snow on land since 1981 
some of the largest declines have been observed in the spring
during the 21st century, snow cover is projected to continue its retreat in almost all regions.: 39–69 
glaciers and ice sheets decline further information: retreat of glaciers since 1850 since the beginning of the twentieth century, there has been a widespread retreat of glaciers
: 1215 those glaciers that are not associated with the polar ice sheets lost around 8% of their mass between 1971 and 2019.: 1275 in the andes in south america and in the himalayas in asia, the retreat of glaciers could impact water supply
the melting of those glaciers could also cause landslides or glacial lake outburst floods
the melting of the greenland and west antarctic ice sheets will continue to contribute to sea level rise over long time-scales
the greenland ice sheet loss is mainly driven by melt from the top
antarctic ice loss is driven by warm ocean water melting the outlet glaciers.: 1215 
future melt of the west antarctic ice sheet is potentially abrupt under a high emission scenario, as a consequence of a partial collapse
: 595–596 part of the ice sheet is grounded on bedrock below sea level
this makes it possibly vulnerable to the self-enhancing process of marine ice sheet instability
marine ice cliff instability could also contribute to a partial collapse
but there is limited evidence for its importance
: 1269–1270 a partial collapse of the ice sheet would lead to rapid sea level rise and a local decrease in ocean salinity
it would be irreversible for decades and possibly even millennia
: 595–596 the complete loss of the west antarctic ice sheet would cause over 5 metres (16 ft) of sea level rise
in contrast to the west antarctic ice sheet, melt of the greenland ice sheet is projected to take place more gradually over millennia
: 595–596 sustained warming between 1 °c (1.8 °f) (low confidence) and 4 °c (7.2 °f) (medium confidence) would lead to a complete loss of the ice sheet
this would contribute 7 m (23 ft) to sea levels globally
: 363 the ice loss could become irreversible due to a further self-enhancing feedback
this is called the elevation-surface mass balance feedback
when ice melts on top of the ice sheet, the elevation drops
air temperature is higher at lower altitudes, so this promotes further melting.: 362 
sea ice decline further information: arctic sea ice decline and antarctic sea ice § recent trends and climate change
reporting the reduction in antarctic sea ice extent in mid 2023, researchers concluded that a "regime shift" may be taking place "in which previously important relationships no longer dominate sea ice variability"
sea ice reflects 50% to 70% of the incoming solar radiation back into space
only 6% of incoming solar energy is reflected by the ocean
as the climate warms, the area covered by snow or sea ice decreases
after sea ice melts, more energy is absorbed by the ocean, so it warms up
this ice-albedo feedback is a self-reinforcing feedback of climate change
large-scale measurements of sea ice have only been possible since we have been using satellites
sea ice in the arctic has declined in recent decades in area and volume due to climate change
it has been melting more in summer than it refreezes in winter
the decline of sea ice in the arctic has been accelerating during the early twenty-first century
it has a rate of decline of 4.7% per decade
it has declined over 50% since the first satellite records
ice-free summers are expected to be rare at 1.5 °c (2.7 °f) degrees of warming
they are set to occur at least once every decade with a warming level of 2 °c (3.6 °f)
: 8 the arctic will likely become ice-free at the end of some summers before 2050.: 9 
sea ice extent in antarctica varies a lot year by year
this makes it difficult to determine a trend, and record highs and record lows have been observed between 2013 and 2023 
the general trend since 1979, the start of the satellite measurements, has been roughly flat
between 2015 and 2023, there has been a decline in sea ice, but due to the high variability, this does not correspond to a significant trend
permafrost thawing further information: permafrost § impacts of climate change, and climate change in russia § permafrost globally, permafrost warmed by about 0.3 °c between 2007 and 2016 
the extent of permafrost has been falling for decades
more decline is expected in the future
: 1280 permafrost thaw makes the ground weaker and unstable
the thaw can seriously damage human infrastructure in permafrost areas such as railways, settlements and pipelines
: 236 thawing soil can also release methane and co2 from decomposing microbes
this can generate a strong feedback loop to global warming
some scientists believe that carbon storage in permafrost globally is approximately 1600 gigatons
this is twice the atmospheric pool
wildlife and nature main article: effects of climate change on ecosystems see also: extinction risk from climate change recent warming has had a big effect on natural biological systems
species worldwide are moving poleward to colder areas
on land, species may move to higher elevations
marine species find colder water at greater depths
climate change had the third biggest impact on nature out of various factors in the five decades up to 2020 
only change in land use and sea use and direct exploitation of organisms had a bigger impact
the impacts of climate change on nature are likely to become bigger in the next few decades
the stresses caused by climate change, combine with other stresses on ecological systems such as land conversion, land degradation, harvesting, and pollution
they threaten substantial damage to unique ecosystems
they can even result in their complete loss and the extinction of species
this can disrupt key interactions between species within ecosystems
this is because species from one location do not leave the warming habitat at the same rate
the result is rapid changes in the way the ecosystem functions
impacts include changes in regional rainfall patterns
another is earlier leafing of trees and plants over many regions
movements of species to higher latitudes and altitudes, changes in bird migrations, and shifting of the oceans' plankton and fish from cold- to warm-adapted communities are other impacts
these changes of land and ocean ecosystems have direct effects on human well-being
for instance, ocean ecosystems help with coastal protection and provide food
freshwater and land ecosystems can provide water for human consumption
furthermore, these ecosystems can store carbon
this helps to stabilize the climate system
ecosystems on land further information: effects of climate change on plant biodiversity climate change is a major driver of biodiversity loss in different land types
these include cool conifer forests, savannas, mediterranean-climate systems, tropical forests, and the arctic tundra
in other ecosystems, land-use change may be a stronger driver of biodiversity loss, at least in the near term
beyond 2050, climate change may be the major cause of biodiversity loss globally
climate change interacts with other pressures
these include habitat modification, pollution and invasive species
through this interaction, climate change increases the risk of extinction for many terrestrial and freshwater species
at 1.2 °c (2.2 °f) of warming (around 2023) some ecosystems are threatened by mass die-offs of trees and from heatwaves
at 2 °c (3.6 °f) of warming, around 10% of species on land would become critically endangered
this differs by group
for instance insects and salamanders are more vulnerable.: 259 
the rate of global tree cover loss has approximately doubled since 2001, to an annual loss approaching an area the size of italy
rainfall on the amazon rainforest is recycled when it evaporates back into the atmosphere instead of running off away from the rainforest
this water is essential for sustaining the rainforest
due to deforestation the rainforest is losing this ability
this effect is even worse because climate change brings more frequent droughts to the area
the higher frequency of droughts in the first two decades of the 21st century and other data signal that a tipping point from rainforest to savanna might be close
a 2019 study concluded that this ecosystem could begin a 50-year-long collapse to a savanna around 2021 
after that it would become increasingly and disproportionally more difficult to prevent or reverse this shift
marine ecosystems main articles: effects of climate change on oceans § impacts on marine life, ocean acidification, and ocean deoxygenation marine heatwaves are happening more often
they have widespread impacts on life in the oceans
these include mass dying events and coral bleaching
harmful algae blooms have increased
this is in response to warming waters, loss of oxygen and eutrophication
: 451 melting sea ice destroys habitat, including for algae that grows on its underside
ocean acidification can harm marine organisms in various ways
shell-forming organisms like oysters are particularly vulnerable
some phytoplankton and seagrass species may benefit
however, some of these are toxic to fish phytoplankton species
their spread poses risks to fisheries and aquaculture
fighting pollution can reduce the impact of acidification
warm-water coral reefs are very sensitive to global warming and ocean acidification
coral reefs provide a habitat for thousands of species
they provide ecosystem services such as coastal protection and food
the resilience of reefs can be improved by curbing local pollution and overfishing
but 70–90% of today's warm-water coral reefs will disappear even if warming is kept to 1.5 °c (2.7 °f)
: 179 coral reefs are framework organisms
they build physical structures that form habitats for other sea creatures
other framework organisms are also at risk from climate change
mangroves and seagrass are considered to be at moderate risk from lower levels of global warming.: 225 
tipping points and irreversible impacts main articles: tipping points in the climate system and abrupt climate change
possible tipping elements in the climate system
examples of some effects of global warming that can amplify (positive feedbacks) or reduce (negative feedbacks) global warming observations and modeling studies indicate that there is a net positive feedback to earth's current global warming
positive feedbacks can propel the climate system toward tipping points
feedbacks that reinforce themselves can make climate change worse
the climate system exhibits "threshold behaviour" or tipping points when these feedbacks lead parts of the earth system into a new state
examples are the runaway loss of ice sheets or the dieback of forests
tipping behaviour is found in all parts of the climate system
these include ecosystems, ice sheets, and the circulation of the ocean and atmosphere
tipping points are studied using data from earth's distant past and by physical modelling
there is already moderate risk of global tipping points at 1 °c (1.8 °f) above pre-industrial temperatures
that becomes a high risk at 2.5 °c (4.5 °f)
: 254, 258 it is possible that some tipping points are close or have already been crossed
examples are the west antarctic and greenland ice sheets, the amazon rainforest and warm-water coral reefs
tipping points are perhaps the most dangerous aspect of future climate change
they would to irreversible impacts on society
a collapse of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation would likely halve rainfall in india
it would probably lead to severe drops in temperature in northern europe
many tipping points are interlinked
this means triggering one may lead to a cascade of effects
this could happen even well below 2 °c (3.6 °f) of warming
a 2018 study states that 45% of environmental problems, including those caused by climate change, are interconnected
this makes the risk of a domino effect bigger
further impacts may be irreversible, at least over the timescale of many human generations
this includes warming of the deep ocean and acidification
these are set to continue even when global temperatures stop rising
in biological systems, the extinction of species would be an irreversible impact
in social systems, unique cultures may be lost
climate change could make it more likely that endangered languages disappear
health, food security and water security humans have a climate niche
this is a certain range of temperatures in which they flourish
outside that niche, conditions are less favourable
this leads to negative effects on health, food security and more
this niche is a mean annual temperature above 29ºc
as of may 2023, 60 million people lived outside this niche
with every additional 0.1 degree of warming, 140 million people will be pushed out of it
health this section is an excerpt from effects of climate change on human health
[edit] the effects of climate change on human health are increasingly well studied and quantified
rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns are increasing the frequency and severity of heat waves, wildfires, droughts, floods, landslides, hurricanes, and other causes of injury and illness
heat waves and extreme weather events have a big impact on health both directly and indirectly
direct effects of exposure to high and extended temperatures include illness, reduced labour capacity for outdoor workers, and heat-related mortality
in addition to direct impacts, climate change and extreme weather events cause changes in the biosphere, indirectly affecting air and water quality and increasing the potential for disease
air pollution causes damage to the heart, lungs, and other vital organs
contaminated water and poor sanitation increase transmission of infectious diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and polio
climate-sensitive pathogens and vector-borne diseases may increase in some regions
changes in temperature are creating conditions favorable to mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever, and waterborne diseases including diarrhoeal disease
multiple factors are increasing the potential for zoonotic diseases to "jump" between species and to affect humans
climate change will impact where infectious diseases are able to spread in the future
many infectious diseases will spread to new geographic areas where people have not previously been exposed or developed immunity
changes in climate are causing decreasing global yields for all major crops, resulting in higher food costs, food insecurity, and undernutrition
water insecurity is also a concern
increases in poverty, displacement, migration, violent conflict, and negative effects on mental health are all occurring
this section is an excerpt from effects of climate change on mental health
[edit] the effects of climate change on mental health and wellbeing are documented
this is especially the case for vulnerable populations and those with pre-existing serious mental illness
there are three broad pathways by which these effects can take place: directly, indirectly or via awareness
the direct pathway includes stress-related conditions caused by exposure to extreme weather events
these include post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd)
scientific studies have linked mental health to several climate-related exposures
these include heat, humidity, rainfall, drought, wildfires and floods
the indirect pathway can be disruption to economic and social activities
an example is when an area of farmland is less able to produce food
the third pathway can be of mere awareness of the climate change threat, even by individuals who are not otherwise affected by it
an additional aspect to consider is the detrimental impact climate change can have on green or blue natural spaces, which in themselves have been proven to have beneficial impact on mental health
impacts of anthropogenic climate change, such as freshwater pollution or deforestation, degrade these landscapes and reduce public access
even when the green and blue spaces are intact, access to them is not equal across society, which is an issue of environmental justice and economic inequality
food security main articles: effects of climate change on agriculture, climate change and fisheries, and effects of climate change on livestock climate change will affect agriculture and food production around the world
the reasons include the effects of elevated co2 in the atmosphere
higher temperatures and altered precipitation and transpiration regimes are also factors
increased frequency of extreme events and modified weed, pest, and pathogen pressure are other factors
droughts result in crop failures and the loss of pasture for livestock
loss and poor growth of livestock cause milk yield and meat production to decrease
the rate of soil erosion is 10–20 times higher than the rate of soil accumulation in agricultural areas that use no-till farming
in areas with tilling it is 100 times higher
climate change worsens this type of land degradation and desertification.: 5 
climate change is projected to negatively affect all four pillars of food security
it will affect how much food is available
it will also affect how easy food is to access through prices, food quality, and how stable the food system is
climate change is already affecting the productivity of wheat and other staples
in many areas fisheries catches are already decreasing because of global warming and changes in biochemical cycles
in combination with overfishing, warming waters decrease the amount of fish in the ocean
: 12 per degree of warming, ocean biomass is expected to decrease by about 5%
tropical and subtropical oceans are most affected, while there may be more fish in polar waters
water security water resources can be affected by climate change in various ways
the total amount of freshwater available can change, for instance due to dry spells or droughts
heavy rainfall and flooding can have an impact on water quality
they can transport pollutants into water bodies through increased surface runoff
in coastal regions, more salt may find its way into water resources due to higher sea levels and more intense storms
higher temperatures also directly degrade water quality
this is because warm water contains less oxygen
changes in the water cycle threaten existing and future water infrastructure
it will be harder to plan investments for water infrastructure
this is because there are significant uncertainties about future variability of the water cycle
between 1.5 and 2.5 billion people live in areas with regular water security issues
if global warming reaches 4 °c (7.2 °f), water insecurity would affect about twice as many people
water resources are likely to decrease in most dry subtropical regions and mid-latitudes
but they will increase in high latitudes
however, variable streamflow means even regions with increased water resources can experience additional short-term shortages
: 251 in the arid regions of india, china, the us and africa dry spells and drought are already affecting water availability
human settlement climate change is particularly likely to affect the arctic, africa, small islands, asian megadeltas and the middle east regions
low-latitude, less-developed regions are most at risk of experiencing negative climate change impacts
the ten countries of the association of southeast asian nations (asean) are among the most vulnerable in the world to the negative effects of climate change
asean's climate mitigation efforts are not in proportion to the climate change threats the region faces
impacts from heat further information: climate change and cities
overlap between future population distribution and extreme heat in a high emission scenario regions inhabited by a third of the human population could become as hot as the hottest parts of the sahara within 50 years
this would happen if greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow rapdily without a change in patterns of population growth and without migration
the projected average temperature of above 29 °c (84 °f) for these regions would be outside the "human temperature niche"
this is a range for climate that is biologically suitable for humans
it is based on historical data of mean annual temperatures
the most affected regions have little adaptive capacity
increased extreme heat exposure from climate change and the urban heat island effect threatens urban settlements
this is made worse by the loss of shade from urban trees that cannot withstand the heat stress
in 2019, the crowther lab from eth zurich paired the climatic conditions of 520 major cities worldwide with the predicted climatic conditions of cities in 2050 
it found that 22% of the major cities would have climatic conditions that do not exist in any city today
for instance, 2050 london would have a climate similar to 2019 melbourne in australia
athens and madrid would be like fez in morocco
nairobi in kenya would be like maputo in mozambique
the indian city pune would be like bamako in mali and bamako would be like niamey in niger
brasilia would be like goiania, both in brazil
low-lying coastal regions further information: effects of climate change on small island countries low-lying cities and other settlements near the sea face multiple simultaneous risks from climate change
they face flooding risks from sea level rise
in addition they may face impacts from more severe storms, ocean acidification, and salt intrusion into the groundwater
changes like continued development in exposed areas increase the risks that these regions face
floodplains and low-lying coastal areas will flood more frequently due to climate change, like this area of myanmar which was submerged by cyclone nargis
population density on the coasts is high
estimates of the number of people at risk of coastal flooding from climate-driven sea level rise vary
estimates range from 190 million to 300 million
it could even be 640 million in a worst-case scenario related to the instability of the antarctic ice sheet
people are most affected in the densely-populated low-lying megadeltas of asia and africa
small island developing states are especially vulnerable
they are likely to experience more intense storm surges, salt water intrusion and coastal destruction
low-lying small islands in the pacific, indian, and caribbean regions even risk permanent inundation
this would displace their population
on the islands of fiji, tonga and western samoa, migrants from outer islands inhabit low and unsafe areas along the coasts
the entire populations of small atoll nations such as kiribati, maldives, the marshall islands, and tuvalu are at risk of being displaced
this could raise issues of statelessness
several factors increase their vulnerability
these are small size, isolation from other land, low financial resources, and lack of protective infrastructure
impacts on societies climate change has many impacts on society
it affects health, the availability of drinking water and food, inequality and economic growth
the effects of climate change are often interlinked
they can exacerbate each other as well as existing vulnerabilities
some areas may become too hot for humans to live in
climate-related changes or disasters may lead people in some areas to move to other parts of the country or to other countries
some scientists describe the effects of climate change, with continuing increases in greenhouse gas emissions, as a "climate emergency" or "climate crisis"
some researchers and activists describe them as an existential threat to civilization
some define these threats under climate security
the consequences of climate change, and the failure to address it, can distract people from tackling its root causes
this leads to what some researchers have termed a "climate doom loop"
displacement and migration further information: climate change adaptation § added migration pressures, and climate migrant displacement is when people move within a country
migration is when they move to another country
some people use the terms interchangeably
climate change affects displacement in several ways
more frequent and severe weather-related disasters may increase involuntary displacement
these destroy homes and habitats
climate impacts such as desertification and rising sea levels gradually erode livelihoods
they force communities to abandon traditional homelands
other forms of migration are adaptive and voluntary
they are based on individual or household decisions
: 1079 on the other hand, some households may fall into poverty or get poorer due to climate change
this limits their ability to move to less affected areas
migration due to climate and weather is usually within countries
but it is long-distance
slow-onset disasters such as droughts and heat are more likely to cause long-term migration than weather disasters like floods
migration due to desertification and reduced soil fertility is typically from rural areas in developing countries to towns and cities.: 109 
according to the internal displacement monitoring centre, extreme weather events displaced approximately 30 million people in 2020 
violence and wars displaced approximately 10 million in the same year
there may have been a contribution of climate change to these conflicts
in 2018, the world bank estimated that climate change will cause internal migration of between 31 and 143 million people by 2050 
this would be as they escape crop failures, water scarcity, and sea level rise
the study covered only sub-saharan africa, south asia, and latin america
sea level rise at the marshall islands, reaching the edge of a village (from the documentary one word) conflict main article: climate security
overlap between state fragility, extreme heat, and nuclear and biological catastrophic hazards climate change can worsen conflicts over water and other resources
climate change can also cause large population dislocations and migration
this can lead to increased tensions
at the micro level, climate change has also been found to lead to spikes in violent crime
scientists have found that factors other than climate change were more important in affecting conflict over the last century
one such factor is inequality between groups
another is low socio-economic development
in some cases, climate change can lead to more peaceful relationships between groups
this is because environmental problems need common policies
global warming has been described as a "threat multiplier"
conditions in certain places make it more likely that climate change will have an impact on conflict
these include ethnic exclusion, economies dependent on agriculture, insufficient infrastructure, poor local governance, and low levels of development
a spike in wheat prices following crop losses from a period of drought may have contributed to the onset of the "arab spring" protests and revolutions in 2010 
economic impacts main article: economic analysis of climate change
business activities affected by climate changed as found in the european investment bank investment survey 2020 economic forecasts of the impact of global warming vary considerably
the impacts are worse if there is insufficient adaptation
economic modelling may underrate the impact of catastrophic climatic changes
when estimating losses, economists choose a discount rate
this determines how much one prefers to have goods or cash now compared to at a future date
using a high discount rate may understate economic losses
this is because losses for future generations weigh less heavily
economic impacts are bigger the more the temperature rises
scientists have compared impacts with warming of 1.5 ºc (2.7 ºf) and a level of 3.66 ºc (6.59 ºf)
they use this higher figure to represent no efforts to stop emissions
they found that total damages at 1.5 ºc were 90% less than at 3.66 ºc
: 256 one study found that global gdp at the end of the century would be 3.5% less if warming is limited to 3 °c (5.4 °f)
this study excludes the potential effect of tipping points
another study found that excluding tipping points underestimates the global economic impact by a factor of two to eight
: 256 another study found that a temperature rise of 2 °c (3.6 °f) by 2050 would reduce global gdp by 2.5%–7.5%
by 2100 in this scenario the temperature would rise by 4 °c (7.2 °f)
this could reduce global gdp by 30% in the worst case
global losses reveal rapidly rising costs due to extreme weather events since the 1970s
socio-economic factors have contributed to the observed trend of global losses
these factors include population growth and increased wealth
regional climatic factors also play a role
these include changes in precipitation and flooding events
it is difficult to quantify the relative impact of socio-economic factors and climate change on the observed trend
the trend does suggest social systems are increasing vulnerable to climate change
economic inequality
rich nations have done the most to fuel climate change
climate change has contributed to global economic inequality
wealthy countries in colder regions have felt little overall economic impact from climate change or may have benefited
poor hotter countries probably grew less than if there had been no global warming
highly affected sectors climate change has a bigger impact on economic sectors directly affected by weather than on other sectors
it heavily affects agriculture, fisheries and forestry
it also affects the tourism and energy sectors
agriculture and forestry have suffered economic losses due to droughts and extreme heat
if global warming goes over 1.5 ºc, there may be limits to how much tourism and outdoor work can adapt
in the energy sector, thermal power plants depend on water to cool them
climate change can increase the likelihood of drought and fresh water shortages
higher operating temperatures make them less efficient
this reduces their output
hydropower is affected by changes in the water cycle such as river flows
diminished river flows can cause power shortages in areas that depend on hydroelectric power
brazil relies on hydroelectricity
so it is particularly vulnerable
rising temperatures, lower water flow, and changes in rainfall could reduce total energy production by 7% annually by the end of the century
climate change affects oil and natural gas infrastructure
this is also vulnerable to the increased risk of disasters such as storms, cyclones, flooding and rising sea levels
global warming affects the insurance and financial services sectors
: 212–213, 228, 252 insurance is an important tool to manage risks
but it is often unavailable to poorer households
due to climate change, premiums are going up for certain types of insurance, such as flood insurance
poor adaptation to climate change further widens the gap between what people can afford and the costs of insurance, as risks increase
in 2019 munich re said climate change could make home insurance unaffordable for households at or below average incomes
social impacts on vulnerable groups climate change does not affect people within communities in the same way
it can have a bigger impact on vulnerable groups such as women, the elderly, religious minorities and refugees than on others
people living in poverty: climate change disproportionally affects poor people in low-income communities and developing countries around the world
those in poverty have a higher chance of experiencing the ill-effects of climate change, due to their increased exposure and vulnerability
a 2020 world bank paper estimated that between 32 million to 132 million additional people will be pushed into extreme poverty by 2030 due to climate change
women: climate change increases gender inequality
it reduces women's ability to be financially independent, and has an overall negative impact on the social and political rights of women
this is especially the case in economies that are heavily based on agriculture
indigenous peoples: indigenous communities tend to rely more on the environment for food and other necessities
this makes them more vulnerable to disturbances in ecosystems
indigenous communities across the globe generally have bigger economic disadvantages than non-indigenous communities
this is due to the oppression they have experienced
these disadvantages include less access to education and jobs and higher rates of poverty
all this makes them more vulnerable to climate change
children: the lancet review on health and climate change lists children among the worst-affected by global warming
children are 14–44 percent more likely to die from environmental factors
possibility of societal collapse main articles: climate change and civilizational collapse and global catastrophe scenarios § climate change climate change has long been described as a severe risk to humans
climate change as an existential threat has emerged as a key theme in the climate movement
people from small island nations also use this theme
there has not been extensive research in this topic
existential risks are threats that could cause the extinction of humanity or destroy the potential of intelligent life on earth
key risks of climate change do not fit that definition
however, some key climate risks do have an impact people's ability to survive
for instance, areas may become too hot to survive, or sea level rise may make it impossible to live at a specific location
long-term scenarios (up to 2500) in 2021, researchers found that projecting effects of greenhouse gas emissions only for up to 2100, as widely practiced in research and policy-making, is short-sighted
they then modeled rcps, climate change scenarios and their effects for up to 2500
global warming
bobcat fire in monrovia, ca, september 10, 2020 bleached colony of acropora coral a dry riverbed in california, which is experiencing its worst megadrought in 1,200 years
some things global warming makes worse (clockwise from top left): wildfires, droughts, and dead coral killed by the ocean getting more hot and acidic
earth's average temperature, shown by measurements from various scientific organizations, has increased since the industrial revolution
places that have become warmer (red) and cooler (blue) over the past 50 years global warming is the rise in temperature of the air and oceans globally
it is happening mainly because humans burn coal, oil, and natural gas; and cut down forests
average temperatures today are about 1 °c (1.8 °f) higher than before people started burning a lot of coal around 1750 
in some parts of the world it is less, and in some, more
most climate scientists say that by the year 2100, temperatures will be 2 °c (3.6 °f) to 4 °c (7.2 °f) higher than they were before 1750 
global warming is a significant and rapidly accelerating issue caused by human activities, such as greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and the burning of fossil fuels
it is having a profound impact on the environment and our planet
the present global warming is mostly because of people burning things, like gasoline for cars and natural gas to keep houses warm
but the heat from the burning itself only makes the world a tiny bit warmer: it is the carbon dioxide from the burning which is the biggest part of the problem
among greenhouse gases, the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is the main cause of global warming
svante arrhenius predicted this more than a hundred years ago
arrhenius confirmed the work of joseph fourier 200 years ago
when people burn fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas this adds carbon dioxide into the air
this is because fossil fuels contain lots of carbon and burning means joining most of the atoms in the fuel with oxygen
when people cut down many trees (deforestation), this means less carbon dioxide is taken out of the atmosphere by those plants
animals which have four places in their stomachs, like cows and sheep, also cause global warming, because their burps contain a greenhouse gas called methane
as the earth's surface temperature becomes hotter the sea level rises
this is partly because water over 4 °c (39 °f) expands when it gets warmer
it is also partly because warm temperatures make glaciers and ice caps melt
the sea level rise causes coastal areas to flood
weather patterns, including where and how much rain or snow there is, are changing
deserts will probably get bigger
colder areas will warm up faster than warm areas
strong storms may become more likely and farming may not make as much food
these changes will not be the same everywhere
in the paris agreement almost all governments agreed to keep temperature rise below 2 °c (3.6 °f), but current plans are not enough to limit global warming that much
people in government and the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) are talking about global warming
but governments, companies, and other people do not agree on what to do about it
some things that could reduce warming are to burn less fossil fuels, grow more trees, eat less meat, and put some carbon dioxide back in the ground
people could adapt to some temperature change
a few people think nothing should change
temperature changes see also: temperature record of the past 1000 years
a graph of temperatures over the past two thousand years
the so-called medieval warm period and little ice age were regional phenomena, and were not experienced worldwide
climate change has happened constantly over the history of the earth, including the coming and going of ice ages
but modern climate change is different because people are putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere more quickly than before
since the 1800s, people have recorded the daily temperature
by about 1850, there were enough places measuring temperature so that scientists could know the global average temperature
compared with before people started burning a lot of coal for industry, the temperature has risen by about 1 °c (1.8 °f)
in 1979, satellites started measuring the temperature of the earth
before 1850, there were not enough temperature measurements for us to know how warm or cold it was
climatologists measure other things to try to figure out past temperatures before there were thermometers
this means measuring things that change when it gets colder or warmer
one way is to cut into a tree and measure how far apart the growth rings are
trees that live a long time can give us an idea of how temperature and rain changed while they were alive
for most of the past 2000 years the average temperature of the world didn't change much
there were some times where the temperatures were a little warmer or cooler in some places
one of the most famous warm times was the medieval warm period and one of the most famous cool times was the little ice age (not really an ice age)
tree ring dating can only help scientists work out the temperature back to about 10,000 years ago
ice cores are used to find out all the temperature back to almost a million years ago, and for some times to over 4 million years ago
greenhouse gases see the main article: greenhouse effect
fossil fuel related co2 emissions compared to five ipcc scenarios
the dips are related to global recessions
there are several greenhouse gases that cause the earth to warm
the most important one is carbon dioxide (co2)
co2 comes from power plants which burn coal and natural gas to make electricity
cars also emit co2 when they burn petrol
about 35 billion tons of carbon dioxide are released into the earth's atmosphere each year
the amount of co2 in the air is about 50% more than it was around 1750 
about three-quarters of the co2 that people have put in the air during the past 20 years are due to burning fossil fuel like coal or oil
the rest mostly comes from changes in how land is used, like cutting down trees
the second most important greenhouse gas is methane
a tonne of methane is much more warming than a tonne of co2 but methane stays in the atmosphere for only about ten years
about 40% comes from nature, like wetlands; and the rest is because of humans, like cows, landfill and leaks when oil and gas are produced
dust dust in the air may come from natural sources such as volcanos, erosion and meteoric dust
some of this dust falls out within a few hours
some is aerosol, so small that it could stay in the air for years
the aerosol particles in the atmosphere make the earth colder
the effect of dust therefore cancels out some of the effects of greenhouse gases
even though humans also put aerosols in the air when they burn coal or oil this only cancels out the greenhouse effect of the fuel burning for less than 20 years: however the carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere much longer and keeps on warming the earth
when people burn stuff like the aerosols, for example smoke, are bad because when people breath them they make people ill. but some people say that in a climate change emergency the earth could be kept cool by reflecting some sunlight back into space, for example by putting aerosols very high in the air or making clouds whiter
they say this would give more time to do a proper fix
this is so easy and cheap that even a middle-size country could do it
but there are a lot of problems: for example it might be good for that country but bad for some other countries
extreme weather [icon] this section needs more information
global warming can make dangerous heatwaves
slowing climate change some people burn less fossil fuel
countries try to emit less greenhouse gases
the kyoto protocol was signed in 1997 
it was meant to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to below their levels in 1990 
however, carbon dioxide levels have continued to rise
energy conservation is used to burn less fossil fuel
people can also use energy sources that don't burn fossil fuel, like solar panels or electricity from nuclear power or wind power
or they can prevent the carbon dioxide from getting out into the atmosphere, which is called carbon capture and storage (ccs)
dealing with impacts of climate change people can change how they live because of the effect of climate change
for example, they can go to places where the weather is better, or build walls around cities to keep flood water out
this cost money, and rich people and rich countries will be able to change more easily than the poor
history of climate change science
joseph fourier; first to explain climate change
svante arrhenius; believed climate change would take many years as early as the 1820s some scientists were discussing climate change: sunlight heats the surface of the earth, and joseph fourier suggested that some of the heat radiated from the surface is trapped by the atmosphere before it can escape into space
this is called the greenhouse effect
in 1856 eunice newton foote did tests which showed that the warming effect of the sun is greater for air with water vapour than for dry air, and that the effect is even greater with carbon dioxide
so she said that "an atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature."
the greenhouse effect and its impact on climate were described in this 1912 popular mechanics article meant for reading by the general public
starting in 1859, john tyndall showed that nitrogen and oxygen—together totaling 99% of dry air—are transparent to radiated heat
however, water vapour and gases such as methane and carbon dioxide absorb radiated heat and re-radiate that heat into the atmosphere
tyndall suggested that changes in the concentration of these gases may have caused climatic changes in the past, including ice ages
in 1896, svante arrhenius tried to prove that it would take thousands of years for the industrial production of co2 to raise the earth’s temperature 5-6°c
in the mid 20th century, scientists worked out that there was a 10% increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over the 19th century, which made it a bit warmer
it was at this time that people believed the emissions of co2 would increase exponentially in the future and the oceans would absorb any surplus of greenhouse gases
in 1956, gilbert n. plass decided that greenhouse gas emissions would have an effect on the earth’s temperature
he argued that not thinking about ghg emissions would be a mistake
soon after, scientists studying all different kinds of science began to work together to figure out the mystery of ghg emissions and their effects
as technology advanced, it was in the 1980s that there was proof of a rise in co2 levels
an ice core, captured through drilling, provided clear evidence that carbon dioxide levels have risen
effects of global warming on sea levels sea level is rising because water over 4 °c (39 °f) expands when it gets warmer
probably more important is the melting of ice sheets
the antarctica and greenland ice sheets are melting
sea level will rise between half and one meter by 2100, and between 2 and 7 meter by 2300 
low-lying areas such as bangladesh, florida, the netherlands and other areas face massive flooding
cities affected by current sea level rise many cities are sea ports and under threat of flooding if the present sea level rises
these and the other cities have either started trying to deal with rising sea level and related storm surge, or are discussing this, according to reliable sources
rotterdam always was below sea level
london new york city norfolk, virginia, in hampton roads area of united states southampton crisfield, maryland, united states charleston, south carolina miami, florida, has been listed as "the number-one most vulnerable city worldwide" in terms of potential damage to property from storm-related flooding and sea-level rise
